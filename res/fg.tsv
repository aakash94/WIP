1961	"Theme from A Summer Place"	Percy Faith	Male	Where it may rain or storm Yet I'm safe and warm For within that summer place Your arms reach out to me And my heart is free from all care For it knows There are no gloomy skies When seen through the eyes Of those who are blessed with love And the sweet secret of A summer place Is that it's anywhere When two people share All their hopes All their dreams All their love And the sweet secret of a summer place Is that it's anywhere When two people share All their hopes All their dreams, all their love
1961	"Are You Lonesome Tonight?"	Elvis Presley	Male	Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight? Are you sorry we drifted apart? Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?  Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare? Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there? Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again? Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?  I wonder if you are lonesome tonight You know someone said that the world's a stage and each must play a part Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart Act one was where we met I loved you at first glance You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue Then came act two You seemed to change, you acted strange And why, I've never known Honey, you lied when you said you loved me And I had no cause to doubt you But I'd rather go on hearing your lies Than to go on living without you Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there With emptiness all around And if you won't come back to me Then they can bring the curtain down Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again? Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

1962	"The Second Time Around"	Frank Sinatra	Male	Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground It's that second time you hear your love song sung Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young Love's more comfortable the second time you fall Like a friendly home the second time you call Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?

1962	"Take Five"	The Dave Brubeck Quartet	Unknown	"WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING YOUR GUITAR, MAKE BELIEVE YOU'RE PLAYING AN ACTUAL WOMAN," MISTER MANCINI TOLD ME. "GRAB HER BY THE NECK AND MAKE HER HOLLER." My father loves jazz and has an extensive collection of records and reel-to-reel tapes he used to enjoy after returning home from work. He might have entered the house in a foul mood, but once he had his Dexter Gordon and a vodka martini, the stress melted away and everything was "Beautiful, baby, just beautiful." The instant the needle hit that record, he'd loosen his tie and become something other than the conservative engineer with a pocketful of IBM pencils embossed with the command think. "Man, oh man, will you get a load of the chops on this guy? I saw him once at the Blue Note, and I mean to tell you that he blew me right out of my chair! A talent like that comes along only once in a lifetime. The guy was an absolute comet, and there I was in the front row. Can you imagine that?" "Gee," I'd say. "I bet that was really interesting." Empathy was the wrong tack, as it seemed only to irritate him. "You don't know the half of it," my father would say. " 'Really interesting' my butt. You haven't got a clue. You could have taken a hatchet and cut the man's lips right off his face, chopped them off at the quick, and he still would have played better than anyone else out there. That's how good he was." Because it was the music we'd grown up with, I liked to think that my sisters and I had a genuine appreciation for jazz. We preferred it over the music our friends were listening to, yet nothing we did or said could convince him of our devotion. Aside from replaying the tune on your own instrument, how could you prove you were really listening? It was as if he expected us to change color at the end of each selection. Due to his ear and his almost maniacal sense of discipline, I always thought my father would have made an excellent musician. He might have studied the saxophone had he not been born to immigrant parents who considered even pot holders to be an extravagance. They themselves listened only to Greek music, an oxymoron as far as the rest of the world is concerned. Slam its tail in the door of a milk truck and a stray cat could easily yowl out a single certain to top the charts back in Sparta or ThessalonÃ­ki. Jazz was my father's only form of rebellion. It was forbidden in his home, and he appreciated it as though it were his own private discovery. As a young man, he hid his 's under the sofa bed and regularly snuck off to New York City, where he'd haunt the clubs and consort with goateed hipsters. It was a good life while it lasted. He was in his early forties when the company transferred our family to North Carolina. "You expect me to live where?" he'd asked. The Raleigh winters agreed with him, but he would've gladly traded the temperate climate for a decent radio station. Since he was limited to his record and tape collection, it became his dream that his family might fill the void by someday forming a jazz combo. His plan took shape the evening he escorted my sisters Lisa and Gretchen and me to the local state university to see Dave Brubeck, who was then touring with his sons. The audience roared when the quartet took the stage, and I leaned back and shut my eyes, pretending the applause was for me. In order to get that kind of attention, you needed a routine that would knock people's socks off. I'd been working on something in private and now began to imagine bringing it to a larger audience. The act consisted of me dressed in a nice shirt and tie and singing a medley of commercial jingles in the voice of Billie Holiday, who was one of my father's favorite singers. For my Raleigh concert, I'd probably open with the number used to promote the town's oldest shopping center. A quick nod to my accompanist, and I'd launch into "The Excitement of Cameron Village Will Carry You Away." The beauty of my rendition was that it captured both the joy and the sorrow of a visit to Ellisburg's or JCPenney. This would be followed by such crowd pleasers as "Winston Tastes Good Like a Cigarette Should" and the catchy new Coke commercial, "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing." I was lost in my fantasy, ignoring Dave Brubeck and coming up for air only when my father elbowed my ribs to ask, "Are you listening to this? These cats are burning the paint right off the walls!" The other audience members sat calmly, as if in church, while my father snapped his fingers and bobbed his head low against his chest. People pointed, and when we begged him to sit up and act normal, he cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted out a request for "Blue Rondo a La Turk." Driving home from the concert that night, he drummed his palms against the steering wheel, saying, "Did you hear that? The guy just gets better every day! He's up there onstage with his kids by his side--the whole lot of them jamming up a storm. Christ almighty, what I wouldn't give for a family like that. You guys should think of putting an act together." My sister Lisa coughed up a mouthful of grapefruit soda. "No, I mean it," my father said. "All you need are some lessons and instruments and I swear to God you'd go right through the roof." We hoped this was just another of his five-minute ideas, but by the time we reached the house his eyes were still glowing. "That's exactly what you need to do," he said. "I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner." The following afternoon, he bought a baby grand piano. It was a used model that still managed to look imposing, even when positioned on a linoleum floor. We took turns stabbing at the keys, but as soon as the novelty wore off we bolstered it with sofa cushions and turned it into a fort. The piano sat neglected in the traditional sense until my father signed Gretchen up for a series of lessons. Lisa was assigned the flute, and I returned home from a scout meeting one evening to find my instrument leaning against the aquarium in my bedroom. "Hold on to your hat," my father said, "because here's that guitar you always wanted." Surely he had me confused with someone else. While I had regularly petitioned for a brand-name vacuum cleaner, I'd never said anything about wanting a guitar. Nothing about it appealed to me, not even on an aesthetic level. I had my room arranged just so, and the instrument did not fit in with my nautical theme. An anchor, yes. A guitar, no. He wanted me to jam, so I jammed it in my closet, where it remained until he signed me up for a series of private lessons offered at a music shop located on the ground floor of the recently opened North Hills Mall. I fought it as best I could and feigned illness even as he dropped me off for my first appointment. "But I'm sick," I yelled, watching him pull out of the parking lot. "I have a virus, and besides that, I don't want to play a musical instrument--don't you know anything?" When it finally sank in that he wasn't coming back, I lugged my guitar into the music store, where the manager led me to my teacher, a perfectly formed midget named Mister Mancini. I was twelve years old at the time, small for my age, and it was startling to find myself locked in a windowless room with a man who barely reached my chest. It seemed wrong that I would be taller than my teacher, but I kept this observation to myself, saying only, "My father told me to come here. It was all his idea." A fastidious dresser stuck in a small, unfashionable town, Mister Mancini wore clothing I recognized from the young-squires department of Hudson Belk. Some nights he favored button-up shirts with clip-on ties, while other evenings I arrived to find him dressed in flared slacks and snug turtleneck sweaters, a swag of love beads hanging from his neck. His arms were manly and covered in coarse, dark hair, while his voice was high and strange, as if it had been recorded and was now being played back at a faster speed. Not a dwarf but an honest-to-God midget. My fascination was both evident and unwelcome and was nothing he hadn't been subjected to a million times before. He didn't shake my hand, just lit a cigarette and reached for the conch shell he used as an ashtray. Like my father, Mister Mancini assumed that anyone could learn to play the guitar. He had picked it up during a single summer spent in what he called "Hotlanta, G. A." This, I knew, was a racy name given to Atlanta, Georgia. "Now that," he said, "is one classy place if you know where to go." He grabbed my guitar and began tuning it, holding his head close against the strings. "Yessiree kid, the girls down on Peachtree are running wild twenty-four hours a day." He mentioned a woman named Beth, saying, "They threw away the mold and shut down the factory after making that one, you know what I mean?" I nodded my head, having no idea what he was talking about. "She wasn't much of a cook, but, hey, I guess that's why God invented TV dinners." He laughed at his little joke and repeated the line about the frozen dinners as if he would use it later in a comedy routine. "God made TV dinners, yeah, that's good." He told me he'd named his guitar after Beth. "Now I can't keep my hands off it!" he said. "Seriously, though, it helps if you give your instrument a name. What do you think you'll call yours?" "Maybe I'll call it Oliver," I said. It was the name of my hamster, and I was used to saying it. Then again, maybe not. "Oliver?" Mister Mancini set my guitar on the floor. "Oliver? What the hell kind of name is that? If you're going to devote yourself to the guitar, you need to name it after a girl, not a guy." "Oh, right," I said. "Joan. I'll call it . . . Joan." "So tell me about this Joan," he said. "Is she something pretty special?" Joan was the name of one of my cousins, but it seemed unwise to share this information. "Oh, yeah," I said. "Joan's really . . . great. She's tall and . . ." I felt self-conscious using the word tall and struggled to take it back. "She's small and has brown hair and everything." "Is she stacked?" I'd never noticed my cousin's breasts and was working to conceal the horrible secret that I'd never noticed anyone's breasts, not unless, like our housekeeper's, they were large enough to appear freakish. "Stacked? Well, sure," I said. "She's pretty stacked." I was afraid he'd ask me for a more detailed description and was relieved when he crossed the room and removed Beth from her case. He told me that a guitar student needed plenty of discipline. Talent was great, but time had taught him that talent was also extremely rare. "I've got it," he said. "But then again, I was born with it. It's a gift from God, and those of us who have it are very special people." He seemed to know that I was nothing special, just a type, yet another boy whose father had his head in the clouds. "Do you have a feel for the guitar? Do you have any idea what this little baby is capable of?" Without waiting for an answer, he climbed up into his chair and began playing "Light My Fire," adding, "This one is for Joan." "You know that it would be untrue," he sang. "You know that I would be a liar." The little man played beautifully but sang "Light My Fire" as if he were a Webelo scout demanding a match. He finished his opening number, nodded his head in acknowledgment of my applause, and moved on, offering up his own unique and unsettling versions of "The Girl from Ipanema" and "Little Green Apples" while I sat trapped in my seat, my false smile stretched so tight I lost all feeling in the lower half of my face. My fingernails had grown a good three inches by the time he struck his final note and called me close to point out a few simple chords. Before I left, he handed me a half dozen purpled, mimeographed handouts that we both knew were useless. Back at the house, my mother had my dinner warming in the oven. From the living room came the aimless whisper of Lisa's flute; it sounded not unlike the wind whipping through an empty Pepsi can. Down in the basement, either Gretchen was practicing her piano or the cat was chasing a moth across the keys. My mother responded by turning up the volume on the kitchen TV while my father pushed back my plate, set Joan in my lap, and instructed me to play. "Listen to this," he crowed. "A house full of music! Man, this is beautiful." You certainly couldn't accuse him of being unsupportive. His enthusiasm bordered on mania, yet still it failed to inspire us. During practice sessions, my sisters and I would eat potato chips, scowling at our hated instruments and speculating on the lives of our music teachers. They were all peculiar in one way or another, but with a midget, I'd definitely won the my-teacher-is-stranger-than-yours competition. I wondered where Mister Mancini lived and who he might call in case of an emergency. Did he stand on a chair in order to shave, or was his home customized to meet his needs? I'd look at the laundry hamper or the beer cooler, thinking that if it came down to it, Mister Mancini could hide just about anywhere. Though I thought of him constantly, I grabbed any excuse to avoid my guitar. "I've been doing just what you told me to do," I'd say at the beginning of each lesson, "but I just can't get the hang of it. Maybe my fingers are too shor--I mean litt--I mean, maybe I'm just not coordinated enough." He'd arrange Joan in my lap, pick up Beth, and tell me to follow along. "You need to believe you're playing an actual woman," he'd say. "Just grab her by the neck and make her holler." Mister Mancini had a singular talent for making me uncomfortable. He forced me to consider things I'd rather not think about--the sex of my guitar, for instance. If I honestly wanted to put my hands on a woman, would that automatically mean I could play? Gretchen's teacher never told her to think of her piano as a boy. Neither did Lisa's flute teacher, though in that case the analogy was fairly obvious. On the off chance that sexual desire was all it took, I steered clear of Lisa's instrument, fearing I might be labeled a prodigy. The best solution was to become a singer and leave the instruments to somebody else. A song stylist--that was what I wanted to be. I was at the mall with my mother one afternoon when I spotted Mister Mancini reaching up to order a hamburger at Scotty's Chuck Wagon, a fast-food restaurant located a few doors down from the music shop. He sometimes mentioned having lunch with a salesgirl from Jolly's Jewelers--"a real looker"--but on this day he was alone. When asking for his hamburger, Mister Mancini had to stand on tiptoe, and even his head failed to reach the counter. The passing adults politely looked away, but their children were decidedly more vocal. A toddler ambled up on his chubby bowed legs, attempting to embrace my teacher with ketchup-smeared fingers while a party of elementary school students openly stared in wonder. Even worse was the group of adolescents, the boys my own age who sat gath-ered around a large table. "Go back to Oz, munchkin," one of them said, and his friends shook with laughter. Tray in hand, Mister Mancini took a seat and pretended not to notice. The boys weren't yelling, but anyone could tell they were making fun of him. "Honestly, Mother," I said. "Do they have to be such monsters?" Beneath my moral outrage was a strong sense of possessiveness, a fury that other people were sinking their hooks into my own personal midget. What did they know about this man? I was the one who lit his cigarettes and listened as he denounced the careers of so-called pretty boys such as Glen Campbell and Bobby Goldsboro. It was I who had suffered through six weeks' worth of lessons and was still struggling to master "Yellow Bird." If anyone was going to get laughs at his expense, I figured that I should be the first in line. I'd always thought of Mister Mancini as a blowhard, a pocket playboy, but watching him dip his hamburger into a sad puddle of mayonnaise, I broadened my view and came to see him as a wee outsider, a misfit whose take-it-or-leave-it attitude had left him all alone. This was a persona I'd been tinkering with myself: the outcast, the rebel. It occurred to me that, with the exception of the guitar, he and I actually had quite a bit in common. We were both men trapped inside a boy's body. Each of us was talented in his own way, and we both hated twelve-year-old boys, a demographic group second to none in terms of cruelty. All things considered, there was no reason I shouldn't address him, not as a teacher, but as an artistic brother. Maybe then we could drop the pretense of Joan and get down to work. If things worked out the way I hoped, I'd someday mention in interviews that my accompanist was both my best friend and a midget. I wore a tie to my next lesson, and this time, when asked if I'd practiced, I told the truth, saying in a matter-of-fact tone of voice that no, I hadn't laid a finger on my guitar since our last get-together. I told him that Joan was my cousin's name and that I had no idea how stacked she was. "That's okay," Mister Mancini said. "You can call your guitar whatever you want, just so long as you practice." My voice shaking, I told him that I had absolutely no interest in mastering the guitar. What I really wanted was to sing in the voice of Billie Holiday. "Mainly commercials, but not for any banks or car dealerships, because those are usually choral arrangements." The color ebbed from my teacher's face. I told him I'd been working up an act and could use a little accompaniment. Did he know the jingle for the new Sara Lee campaign? "You want me to what?" He wasn't angry, just confused. I felt certain he was lying when he denied knowing the tune. Doublemint gum, Ritz crackers, the theme songs for Alka-Seltzer and Kenmore appliances: He claimed ignorance on all counts. I started in on an a cappella version of the latest Oscar Mayer commercial, hoping he might join in once the spirit moved him. It looked bad, I knew, but in order to sustain the proper mood, I needed to disregard his company and sing the way I did at home when alone in my bedroom, my eyes shut tight and my hands dangling like pointless, empty gloves. My bologna has a first name, it's O-S-C-A-R My bologna has a second name, it's M-A-Y-E-R Oh, I love to eat it every day And if you ask me why I'll say 'Cause Oscar Mayer has a way with B-O-L-O-G-N-A. I reached the end of my tune thinking he might take this as an opportunity to applaud or even apologize for underestimating me. Mild amusement would have been an acceptable response, but instead he held up his hands, as if to stop an advancing car. "Hey, guy," he said. "You can hold it right there. I'm not into that scene." A scene? What scene? I thought I was being original. "There were plenty of screwballs like you back in Atlanta, but me, I don't swing that way--you got it? This might be your 'thing' or whatever, but you can definitely count me out." He reached for his conch shell and stubbed out his cigarette. "I mean, come on now. For God's sake, kid, pull yourself together." I knew then why I'd never sung in front of anyone and why I shouldn't have done it in front of Mister Mancini. He'd used the word screwball, but I knew what he really meant. He meant I should have named my guitar Doug or Brian or, better yet, taken up the flute. He meant that if we're defined by our desires, I was in for a lifetime of trouble. The remainder of the hour was spent awkwardly watching the clock as we silently pretended to tune our guitars. My father was disappointed when I told him I wouldn't be returning for any more lessons. "He told me not to come back," I said. "He told me I have the wrong kind of fingers." Seeing that it had worked for me, my sisters invented similar stories, and together we announced that the Sedaris Trio had officially disbanded. Our father offered to find us better teachers, adding that if we were unhappy with our instruments we could trade them in for something more suitable. "The trumpet or the saxophone or, hey, how about the vibes?" He reached for a Lionel Hampton album, saying, "I want you to sit down and give this a good listen. Just get a load of this cat and tell me he's not an inspiration." There was a time when I could listen to such a record and imagine myself as the headline act at some magnificent New York nightclub, but that's what fantasies are for: They allow you to skip the degradation and head straight to the top. I'd done my solo and would now move on to pursue other, equally unsuccessful ways of getting attention. I'd try every art form there was, and with each disappointment I'd picture Mister Mancini holding his conch shell and saying, "For God's sake, kid, pull yourself together." We told our father no, don't bother playing us any more of your records, but he still persisted. "I'm telling you that this album is going to change your lives, and if it doesn't, I'll give each one of you a five-dollar bill. What do you think of that?" It was a tough call--five dollars for listening to a Lionel Hampton record. We looked at one another, my sisters and I, and then we left the room, ignoring his cry of "Hey, where do you think you're going? Get back in here and listen." We joined our mother at the TV and never looked back. A life in music was his great passion, not ours, and our lessons had taught us that without the passion, the best we could hope for was an occasional engagement at some hippie wedding where, if we were lucky, the guests would be too stoned to realize just how bad we really were. That night, as was his habit, our father fell asleep in front of the stereo, the record making its pointless, silent rounds as he laid back against the sofa cushions, dreaming.

1970	"Is That All There Is?"	Peggy Lee	Female	Our house caught on fire I'll never forget the look on my father's face As he gathered me up in his arms And raced through the burning building onto the pavement And I stood there shivering in my pajamas And watched the whole world go up in flames And when it was all over I said to myself "Is that all there is to a fire?"  Is that all there is? Is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing Let's break out the booze and have a ball If that's all there is And when I was  years old My daddy took me to the circus, The greatest show on earth There were clowns and elephants, dancing bears And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads As I sat there watching I had the feeling that something was missing I don't know what When it was all over I said to myself "Is that all there is to the circus?" Is that all there is? Is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing Let's break out the booze and have a ball If that's all there is And then I fell in love With the most wonderful boy in the world We'd take long walks down by the river Or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes We were so very much in love Then one day he went away And I thought I'd die, but I didn't And when I didn't, I said to myself "Is that all there is to love?" Is that all there is? is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep... I know what you must be saying to yourselves "If that's the way she feels about it, why doesn't she just end it all?" Oh, no. Not me I'm not ready for that final disappointment Cause I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you And when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath, I'll be saying to myself Is that all there is? Is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing Let's break out the booze and have a ball If that's all there is

1970	"Spinning Wheel"	Blood, Sweat & Tears	Unknown	What goes up must come down Spinnin' wheel got to go 'round Talkin' 'bout your troubles it's a cryin' sin Ride a painted pony let the spinnin' wheel spin  You got no money and you got no home Spinnin' wheel all alone Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you never learn Ride a painted pony let the spinnin' wheel turn  Did you find the directing sign on the Straight and narrow highway Would you mind a reflecting sign Just let it shine within your mind And show you the colors that are real  Someone is waiting just for you Spinnin' wheel, spinnin' true Drop all your troubles by the riverside Catch a painted pony on the spinning wheel ride  Someone is waiting just for you Spinnin' wheel, spinnin' true Drop all your troubles by the riverside Ride a painted pony let the spinning wheel fly 
1971	"Bridge over Troubled Water"	Simon & Garfunkel	Male	When you're weary Feeling small When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all I'm on your side When times get rough And friends just can't be found  Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  When you're down and out When you're on the street When evening falls so hard I will comfort you I'll take your part When darkness comes And pain is all around  Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down Sail on Silver Girl Sail on by Your time has come to shine All your dreams are on their way See how they shine, oh If you need a friend I'm sailing right behind  Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind Like a bridge over troubled water I will ease your mind
1971	"(They Long to Be) Close to You"	The Carpenters	Unknown	(Presenta di grand circo La prima del mondo La grand successo Giuliano di Vittorio Fantastico Magnifico Spectaculario) (Here Alice ventured to interrupt "It's very long," she said as politely as she could "Would you tell me first which road?" Tweedledum smiled gently and began again)  The sun was shining on the sea Shining with all his might He did his very best to make The billows smooth and bright And this was odd, because it was The middle of the night  The moon was shining sulkily Because she thought the sun Had got no business to be there After the day was done "It's very rude of him," she said "To come and spoil the fun" The sea was wet as wet could be The sands were dry as dry You could not see a cloud because No cloud was in the sky No birds were flying o'erhead There were no birds to fly  The Walrus and the Carpenter Were walking close at hand They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand "If this were only cleared away They said, "It would be grand"  "If seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year Do you suppose," the Walrus said "That they could get it clear?" "I doubt it," said the Carpenter And shed a bitter tear  "O, Oysters, come and walk with us" The Walrus did beseech "A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk Along the briny beach We cannot do with more than four To give a hand to each" The eldest Oyster looked at him But never a word he said The eldest Oyster winked his eye And shook his heavy head Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster bed  (Alright? You ready? Okay A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four But four young Oysters hurried up All eager for the treat A four young ... you gotta use the chord ... oh 'Cause you gotta go clang One, two ... okay ...clang ...  okay A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four)  But four young Oysters hurried up All eager for their treat Their coats were brushed, their faces washed Their shoes were clean and neat And this was odd because, you know They hadn't any feet Four other Oysters followed them And yet another four And thick and fast they came at last And more, and more, and more All hopping through the frothy waves And scrambling to the shore  The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row  "The time has come," the Walrus said "To talk of many things Of shoes, and ships and sealing wax Of cabbages and kings And why the sea is boiling hot And whether pigs have wings"  (But wait a bit It's alight, we'll let you start But wait a bit Ah, c'mon, get it together, man C'mon One, two, three)  "But wait a bit," the Oysters cried "Before we have our chat For some of us are out of breath And all of us are fat" "No hurry," said the Carpenter They thanked him much for that  "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said "Is what we chiefly need Pepper and vinegar besides Are very good indeed Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear We can begin to feed"  "Not on us," the Oysters cried Turning a little blue "After such kindness that would be A dismal thing to do" "The night is fine," the Walrus said "Do you admire the view?"  "It was so kind of you to come And you are very nice" The Carpenter said nothing but "Cut us another slice I wish you were not quite so deaf I've had to ask you twice"  "It seems a shame," the Walrus said "To play them such a trick After we've brought them out so far And made them trot so quick" The Carpenter said nothing but "The butter's spread too thick"  "I weep for you," the Walrus said "I deeply sympathize" With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size Holding his pocket handkerchief Before his streaming eyes  "O, Oysters," said the Carpenter "You've had a pleasant run Shall we be trotting home again?" But answer came there none And this was scarcely odd because They'd eaten every one They'd eaten every one
1971	"Everything Is Beautiful"	Ray Stevens	Male	Jesus loves the little children All the little children of the world Red and yellow, black and white They are precious in his sight Jesus loves the little children of the world Everything is beautiful In its' own way Like a starry summer night Or a snow covered winter's day Everybody's beautiful In their own way Under God's heaven The world's gonna find a way  There is none so blind That is he who will not see We must not close our minds We must let our thought be free For every hour that passes by You know the world Gets a little bit older It's time to realize That beauty lies In the eyes of the beholder Everything is beautiful In its' own way Like a starry summer nights Or a snow covered winter's day Ah, sing it, children Everybody's beautiful In their own way Under God's heaven The world's gonna find a way  We shouldn't care About the length of his hair Or the color of his skin Don't worry about what shows from without But the love that lives within We're gonna get it all together now Everything gonna work out fine Just take a little time To look on the good side my friend And straighten it out in your mind  Everything is beautiful In its' own way Like a starry summer nights Or a snow covered winter's day Ah, sing it, children Everybody's beautiful In their own way Under God's heaven The world's gonna find a way One more time Everything is beautiful In its' own way Like a starry summer nights
1971	"Fire and Rain"	James Taylor	Male	Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song I just can't remember who to send it to  I've seen fire and I've seen rain I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend But I always thought that I'd see you again  Won't you look down upon me, Jesus You've got to help me make a stand You've just got to see me through another day My body's aching and my time is at hand And I won't make it any other way  Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend But I always thought that I'd see you again  Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now  Thought I'd see you one more time again There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now

1973	"Alone Again (Naturally)"	Gilbert O'Sullivan	Male	In a little while from now If I'm not feeling any less sour I promised myself to treat myself And visit a nearby tower And climbing to the top Will throw myself off In an effort to make it clear to whoever What it's like when you're shattered Left standing in the lurch, at a church Where people saying "My God that's tough, she stood him up No point in us remaining" "We may as well go home" As I did on my own Alone again, naturally  To think that only yesterday I was cheerful, bright and gay Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do The role I was about to play But as if to knock me down Reality came around And without so much as a mere touch Cut me into little pieces Leaving me to doubt All about God and His mercy For if He really does exist Why did He desert me In my hour of need? I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally  It seems to me that There are more hearts Broken in the world That can't be mended Left unattended What do we do? What do we do?  Alone again, naturally Now looking back over the years And what ever else that appears I remember I cried when my father died Never wishing to hide the tears And at sixty-five years old My mother, God rest her soul Couldn't understand, why the only man She had ever loved had been taken Leaving her to start with a heart So badly broken Despite encouragement from me No words were ever spoken And when she passed away I cried and cried all day Alone again, naturally Alone again, naturally
1973	"American Pie"	Don McLean	Male	A long, long time ago I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And maybe they'd be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died  So bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye Singin', "This'll be the day that I die" "This'll be the day that I die"  Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so? Now do you believe in rock 'n roll Can music save your mortal soul? And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singin', "Bye-bye, Miss American Pie" Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye And singin', "This'll be the day that I die" "This'll be the day that I die"  Now, for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned And while Lennon read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died  We were singin', "Bye-bye, Miss American Pie" Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye And singin', "This'll be the day that I die" "This'll be the day that I die" Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and fallin' fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now, the half-time air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance 'Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died?  We started singin', "Bye-bye, Miss American Pie" Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye And singin', "This'll be the day that I die" "This'll be the day that I die"  Oh, and there we were, all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died He was singin', "Bye-bye Miss American Pie" Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye And singin', "This'll be the day that I die" "This'll be the day that I die..."  I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets, the children screamed The lovers cried and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised Him everything I could give If only He would make the music live And He promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn  And they were singin', "Bye-bye Miss American Pie" Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye Singin', "This'll be the day that I die" "This'll be the day that I die"  They were singin', "Bye-bye Miss American Pie" Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye Singin', "This'll be the day that I die..."

2018	"Despacito"	Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber	Male	It’s the question almost everyone wants to argue about and the debate that never seems to end. And before you drop the “Haram Police” card and get ready to prepare an essay response in the comments, can I just say that I’m not here to argue the different rulings and opinions on musical instruments, singing, beat boxing, drums and what not. I’m not even going to go there. I’m going to be doing something different. I want us to answer this question for ourselves, openly and honestly. In fact, we can even forget I even said the word Haram to begin with. Let’s instead just ask the question “Is Music harmful?” And when we say music, I’m going to be very blank, I’m referring to the music that the majority of people are listening to today because that’s what we should be concerned about. The music that’s on our radios, TV’s, phones and iTunes playlists on repeat. The songs that are topping the charts week-in-week-out and have us memorizing their lyrics from A-Z. This is the music I’m referring to. Should we, as Muslims be fine listening to this stuff? Well, let’s take a look for yourselves and decide. The Hot  Billboard Charts has these songs topping the charts for the current week.  Despacito: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee Featuring Justin Bieber “You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on Got the only key, know how to turn it on” Wild Thoughts: DJ Khaled, Rhianna, Bryson Teller “I don’t know if you could take it Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked”  That’s what I like: Bruno Mars “Go pop it for a player, pop-pop it for me Turn around and drop it for a player, drop-drop it for me”  I’m the One: DJ Khaled, Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne, Quavo “Roll my eyes And when she on the molly she a zombie”  Unforgettable: French Montanna “If you loved the girl then I’m so, so sorry I got to give it to her like we in a marriage No, no I won’t tell nobody” “If you want drama, Grab the Uzi”.  A quick Google search of the lyrics of these songs will let you know exactly the kinds of messages they contain. You honestly don’t have to read far until you come across references to drugs, sexual promiscuity, violence or alcohol. Even when lyrics can seem somewhat innocent, they are underlined with the most vulgar and shameless of meanings. And the saddest part of it all, there’s even some Muslims actually making these songs. And yes, I’m sure we can argue all day that not all songs are this bad and there are some “good songs” out there, but the fact of the matter is the statistics speak for themselves when they mention that the vast majority of today’s music is riddled with such references and as the day’s go by content is only getting worse. And as I’ve mentioned before, I’m not here to argue the Islamic rulings on instruments and the various opinions of scholars on music, because, in all honesty, these opinions are irrelevant when we consider them in light of the music being listened to today. I mean, do you seriously want to argue the permissibility of instruments when Muslims are listening to Nicki Minaj? And we can go ahead and argue that we’re strong and that the music isn’t necessarily influencing us, but the fact of the matter is – it does. And whether you realize it or not, when you constantly grant such music free access to your ears, it is affecting you. It’s normalizing the worst of sins to the point we can sing about them happily and joyfully. And if you were so sure that the things you listen to won’t affect your life, why not switch up a music playlist with some Quran and see what change it would have in your life. Even if you don’t understand a word being recited, just listen to it and see what kind of impact it will leave on your soul. There’s no denying that our ears are gateways into our hearts and we should be very careful who we allow access to. And lastly, I know we all have shortcomings and weaknesses, and I know not all of us are the perfect ideal Muslims – but the least we can do is acknowledge that it’s wrong so that perhaps we can start making an effort to change. May Allah help us all.
