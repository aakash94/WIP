1961^"""Theme from A Summer Place"""^Percy Faith^Male^"Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care
For it knows
There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love
And the sweet secret of
A summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes
All their dreams
All their love
And the sweet secret of a summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes
All their dreams, all their love"
1961^"""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"""^Elvis Presley^Male^"Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you are lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage and each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why, I've never known
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?"

Georgia
The whole day through
(The whole day through)
Just an old, sweet song

Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines

Other arms a-reach out to me

Still, in the peaceful dreams, I see
The road leads back to you

1961^"""Mack the Knife"""^Ella Fitzgerald^Female^"And he shows them pearly white
Just a jack-knife has Mac-heath, dear
And he keeps it out of sight
When the shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves though wears Mac-heath, dear
So there's not a trace, not a trace of red
On the sidewalk on a Sunday morning
Lies a body oozing life
Someone's sneaking 'round that corner
Tell me could it be, could it be Mack the Knife
On a tugboat down by the river, don't you know
A cement bag's dropping down
The cement's just for the weight, dear
Bet you that cat called Mack-heath, oh Mack-heath, he's back in town

Hey baby, what's your hurry?

1962^"""Big Bad John"""^Jimmy Dean^Male^"(Big John)
(Big John)

Ev'ry mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six foot six and weighed two forty five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew, ya didn't give no lip to Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, he kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, he just said, ""Hi"" to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land, Big John
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant Oak tree, he just stood there alone, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out, ""There's a light up above""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, Big John
With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Now they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John

1962^"""The Second Time Around"""^Frank Sinatra^Male^"Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet love comes but once and yet
I'm oh so glad we met the second time around
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found
There are those who'll bet love comes but once and yet
I'm oh so glad we met the second time around"
1962^"""Take Five"""^The Dave Brubeck Quartet^Unknown^"""WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING YOUR GUITAR, MAKE BELIEVE YOU'RE PLAYING AN ACTUAL WOMAN,"" MISTER MANCINI TOLD ME. ""GRAB HER BY THE NECK AND MAKE HER HOLLER.""
My father loves jazz and has an extensive collection of records and reel-to-reel tapes he used to enjoy after returning home from work. He might have entered the house in a foul mood, but once he had his Dexter Gordon and a vodka martini, the stress melted away and everything was ""Beautiful, baby, just beautiful."" The instant the needle hit that record, he'd loosen his tie and become something other than the conservative engineer with a pocketful of IBM pencils embossed with the command think.
""Man, oh man, will you get a load of the chops on this guy? I saw him once at the Blue Note, and I mean to tell you that he blew me right out of my chair! A talent like that comes along only once in a lifetime. The guy was an absolute comet, and there I was in the front row. Can you imagine that?""
""Gee,"" I'd say. ""I bet that was really interesting.""
Empathy was the wrong tack, as it seemed only to irritate him.
""You don't know the half of it,"" my father would say. "" 'Really interesting' my butt. You haven't got a clue. You could have taken a hatchet and cut the man's lips right off his face, chopped them off at the quick, and he still would have played better than anyone else out there. That's how good he was.""
Because it was the music we'd grown up with, I liked to think that my sisters and I had a genuine appreciation for jazz. We preferred it over the music our friends were listening to, yet nothing we did or said could convince him of our devotion. Aside from replaying the tune on your own instrument, how could you prove you were really listening? It was as if he expected us to change color at the end of each selection.
Due to his ear and his almost maniacal sense of discipline, I always thought my father would have made an excellent musician. He might have studied the saxophone had he not been born to immigrant parents who considered even pot holders to be an extravagance. They themselves listened only to Greek music, an oxymoron as far as the rest of the world is concerned. Slam its tail in the door of a milk truck and a stray cat could easily yowl out a single certain to top the charts back in Sparta or ThessalonÃ­ki. Jazz was my father's only form of rebellion. It was forbidden in his home, and he appreciated it as though it were his own private discovery. As a young man, he hid his 's under the sofa bed and regularly snuck off to New York City, where he'd haunt the clubs and consort with goateed hipsters. It was a good life while it lasted. He was in his early forties when the company transferred our family to North Carolina.
""You expect me to live where?"" he'd asked.
The Raleigh winters agreed with him, but he would've gladly traded the temperate climate for a decent radio station. Since he was limited to his record and tape collection, it became his dream that his family might fill the void by someday forming a jazz combo.
His plan took shape the evening he escorted my sisters Lisa and Gretchen and me to the local state university to see Dave Brubeck, who was then touring with his sons. The audience roared when the quartet took the stage, and I leaned back and shut my eyes, pretending the applause was for me. In order to get that kind of attention, you needed a routine that would knock people's socks off. I'd been working on something in private and now began to imagine bringing it to a larger audience. The act consisted of me dressed in a nice shirt and tie and singing a medley of commercial jingles in the voice of Billie Holiday, who was one of my father's favorite singers. For my Raleigh concert, I'd probably open with the number used to promote the town's oldest shopping center. A quick nod to my accompanist, and I'd launch into ""The Excitement of Cameron Village Will Carry You Away."" The beauty of my rendition was that it captured both the joy and the sorrow of a visit to Ellisburg's or JCPenney. This would be followed by such crowd pleasers as ""Winston Tastes Good Like a Cigarette Should"" and the catchy new Coke commercial, ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.""
I was lost in my fantasy, ignoring Dave Brubeck and coming up for air only when my father elbowed my ribs to ask, ""Are you listening to this? These cats are burning the paint right off the walls!"" The other audience members sat calmly, as if in church, while my father snapped his fingers and bobbed his head low against his chest. People pointed, and when we begged him to sit up and act normal, he cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted out a request for ""Blue Rondo a La Turk.""
Driving home from the concert that night, he drummed his palms against the steering wheel, saying, ""Did you hear that? The guy just gets better every day! He's up there onstage with his kids by his side--the whole lot of them jamming up a storm. Christ almighty, what I wouldn't give for a family like that. You guys should think of putting an act together.""
My sister Lisa coughed up a mouthful of grapefruit soda.
""No, I mean it,"" my father said. ""All you need are some lessons and instruments and I swear to God you'd go right through the roof."" We hoped this was just another of his five-minute ideas, but by the time we reached the house his eyes were still glowing. ""That's exactly what you need to do,"" he said. ""I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner.""
The following afternoon, he bought a baby grand piano. It was a used model that still managed to look imposing, even when positioned on a linoleum floor. We took turns stabbing at the keys, but as soon as the novelty wore off we bolstered it with sofa cushions and turned it into a fort. The piano sat neglected in the traditional sense until my father signed Gretchen up for a series of lessons. Lisa was assigned the flute, and I returned home from a scout meeting one evening to find my instrument leaning against the aquarium in my bedroom.
""Hold on to your hat,"" my father said, ""because here's that guitar you always wanted.""
Surely he had me confused with someone else. While I had regularly petitioned for a brand-name vacuum cleaner, I'd never said anything about wanting a guitar. Nothing about it appealed to me, not even on an aesthetic level. I had my room arranged just so, and the instrument did not fit in with my nautical theme. An anchor, yes. A guitar, no. He wanted me to jam, so I jammed it in my closet, where it remained until he signed me up for a series of private lessons offered at a music shop located on the ground floor of the recently opened North Hills Mall. I fought it as best I could and feigned illness even as he dropped me off for my first appointment.
""But I'm sick,"" I yelled, watching him pull out of the parking lot. ""I have a virus, and besides that, I don't want to play a musical instrument--don't you know anything?""
When it finally sank in that he wasn't coming back, I lugged my guitar into the music store, where the manager led me to my teacher, a perfectly formed midget named Mister Mancini. I was twelve years old at the time, small for my age, and it was startling to find myself locked in a windowless room with a man who barely reached my chest. It seemed wrong that I would be taller than my teacher, but I kept this observation to myself, saying only, ""My father told me to come here. It was all his idea.""
A fastidious dresser stuck in a small, unfashionable town, Mister Mancini wore clothing I recognized from the young-squires department of Hudson Belk. Some nights he favored button-up shirts with clip-on ties, while other evenings I arrived to find him dressed in flared slacks and snug turtleneck sweaters, a swag of love beads hanging from his neck. His arms were manly and covered in coarse, dark hair, while his voice was high and strange, as if it had been recorded and was now being played back at a faster speed.
Not a dwarf but an honest-to-God midget. My fascination was both evident and unwelcome and was nothing he hadn't been subjected to a million times before. He didn't shake my hand, just lit a cigarette and reached for the conch shell he used as an ashtray. Like my father, Mister Mancini assumed that anyone could learn to play the guitar. He had picked it up during a single summer spent in what he called ""Hotlanta, G. A."" This, I knew, was a racy name given to Atlanta, Georgia. ""Now that,"" he said, ""is one classy place if you know where to go."" He grabbed my guitar and began tuning it, holding his head close against the strings. ""Yessiree kid, the girls down on Peachtree are running wild twenty-four hours a day.""
He mentioned a woman named Beth, saying, ""They threw away the mold and shut down the factory after making that one, you know what I mean?""
I nodded my head, having no idea what he was talking about.
""She wasn't much of a cook, but, hey, I guess that's why God invented TV dinners."" He laughed at his little joke and repeated the line about the frozen dinners as if he would use it later in a comedy routine. ""God made TV dinners, yeah, that's good."" He told me he'd named his guitar after Beth. ""Now I can't keep my hands off it!"" he said. ""Seriously, though, it helps if you give your instrument a name. What do you think you'll call yours?""
""Maybe I'll call it Oliver,"" I said. It was the name of my hamster, and I was used to saying it.
Then again, maybe not.
""Oliver?"" Mister Mancini set my guitar on the floor. ""Oliver? What the hell kind of name is that? If you're going to devote yourself to the guitar, you need to name it after a girl, not a guy.""
""Oh, right,"" I said. ""Joan. I'll call it . . . Joan.""
""So tell me about this Joan,"" he said. ""Is she something pretty special?""
Joan was the name of one of my cousins, but it seemed unwise to share this information. ""Oh, yeah,"" I said. ""Joan's really . . . great. She's tall and . . ."" I felt self-conscious using the word tall and struggled to take it back. ""She's small and has brown hair and everything.""
""Is she stacked?""
I'd never noticed my cousin's breasts and was working to conceal the horrible secret that I'd never noticed anyone's breasts, not unless, like our housekeeper's, they were large enough to appear freakish. ""Stacked? Well, sure,"" I said. ""She's pretty stacked."" I was afraid he'd ask me for a more detailed description and was relieved when he crossed the room and removed Beth from her case. He told me that a guitar student needed plenty of discipline. Talent was great, but time had taught him that talent was also extremely rare. ""I've got it,"" he said. ""But then again, I was born with it. It's a gift from God, and those of us who have it are very special people.""
He seemed to know that I was nothing special, just a type, yet another boy whose father had his head in the clouds.
""Do you have a feel for the guitar? Do you have any idea what this little baby is capable of?"" Without waiting for an answer, he climbed up into his chair and began playing ""Light My Fire,"" adding, ""This one is for Joan.""
""You know that it would be untrue,"" he sang. ""You know that I would be a liar."" The little man played beautifully but sang ""Light My Fire"" as if he were a Webelo scout demanding a match. He finished his opening number, nodded his head in acknowledgment of my applause, and moved on, offering up his own unique and unsettling versions of ""The Girl from Ipanema"" and ""Little Green Apples"" while I sat trapped in my seat, my false smile stretched so tight I lost all feeling in the lower half of my face. My fingernails had grown a good three inches by the time he struck his final note and called me close to point out a few simple chords. Before I left, he handed me a half dozen purpled, mimeographed handouts that we both knew were useless.
Back at the house, my mother had my dinner warming in the oven. From the living room came the aimless whisper of Lisa's flute; it sounded not unlike the wind whipping through an empty Pepsi can. Down in the basement, either Gretchen was practicing her piano or the cat was chasing a moth across the keys. My mother responded by turning up the volume on the kitchen TV while my father pushed back my plate, set Joan in my lap, and instructed me to play. ""Listen to this,"" he crowed. ""A house full
of music! Man, this is beautiful.""
You certainly couldn't accuse him of being unsupportive. His enthusiasm bordered on mania, yet still it failed to inspire us. During practice sessions, my sisters and I would eat potato chips, scowling at our hated instruments and speculating on the lives of our music teachers. They were all peculiar in one way or another, but with a midget, I'd definitely won the my-teacher-is-stranger-than-yours competition. I wondered where Mister Mancini lived and who he might call in case of an emergency. Did he stand on a chair in order to shave, or was his home customized to meet his needs? I'd look at the laundry hamper or the beer cooler, thinking that if it came down to it, Mister Mancini could hide just about anywhere. Though I thought of him constantly, I grabbed any excuse to avoid my guitar.
""I've been doing just what you told me to do,"" I'd say at the beginning of each lesson, ""but I just can't get the hang of it. Maybe my fingers are too shor--I mean litt--I mean, maybe I'm just not coordinated enough."" He'd arrange Joan in my lap, pick up Beth, and tell me to follow along. ""You need to believe you're playing an actual woman,"" he'd say. ""Just grab her by the neck and make her holler.""
Mister Mancini had a singular talent for making me uncomfortable. He forced me to consider things I'd rather not think about--the sex of my guitar, for instance. If I honestly wanted to put my hands on a woman, would that automatically mean I could play? Gretchen's teacher never told her to think of her piano as a boy. Neither did Lisa's flute teacher, though in that case the analogy was fairly obvious. On the off chance that sexual desire was all it took, I steered clear of Lisa's instrument, fearing I might be labeled a prodigy. The best solution was to become a singer and leave the instruments to somebody else. A song stylist--that was what I wanted to be.
I was at the mall with my mother one afternoon when I spotted Mister Mancini reaching up to order a hamburger at Scotty's Chuck Wagon, a fast-food restaurant located a few doors down from the music shop. He sometimes mentioned having lunch with a salesgirl from Jolly's Jewelers--""a real looker""--but on this day he was alone. When asking for his hamburger, Mister Mancini had to stand on tiptoe, and even his head failed to reach the counter. The passing adults politely looked away, but their children were decidedly more vocal. A toddler ambled up on his chubby bowed legs, attempting to embrace my teacher with ketchup-smeared fingers while a party of elementary school students openly stared in wonder. Even worse was the group of adolescents, the boys my own age who sat gath-ered around a large table. ""Go back to Oz, munchkin,"" one of them said, and his friends shook with laughter. Tray in hand, Mister Mancini took a seat and pretended not to notice. The boys weren't yelling, but anyone could tell they were making fun of him. ""Honestly, Mother,"" I said. ""Do they have to be such monsters?"" Beneath my moral outrage was a strong sense of possessiveness, a fury that other people were sinking their hooks into my own personal midget. What did they know about this man? I was the one who lit his cigarettes and listened as he denounced the careers of so-called pretty boys such as Glen Campbell and Bobby Goldsboro. It was I who had suffered through six weeks' worth of lessons and was still struggling to master ""Yellow Bird."" If anyone was going to get laughs at his expense, I figured that I should be the first in line.
I'd always thought of Mister Mancini as a blowhard, a pocket playboy, but watching him dip his hamburger into a sad puddle of mayonnaise, I broadened my view and came to see him as a wee outsider, a misfit whose take-it-or-leave-it attitude had left him all alone. This was a persona I'd been tinkering with myself: the outcast, the rebel. It occurred to me that, with the exception of the guitar, he and I actually had quite a bit in common. We were both men trapped inside a boy's body. Each of us was talented in his own way, and we both hated twelve-year-old boys, a demographic group second to none in terms of cruelty. All things considered, there was no reason I shouldn't address him, not as a teacher, but as an artistic brother. Maybe then we could drop the pretense of Joan and get down to work. If things worked out the way I hoped, I'd someday mention in interviews that my accompanist was both my best friend and a midget.
I wore a tie to my next lesson, and this time, when asked if I'd practiced, I told the truth, saying in a matter-of-fact tone of voice that no, I hadn't laid a finger on my guitar since our last get-together. I told him that Joan was my cousin's name and that I had no idea how stacked she was.
""That's okay,"" Mister Mancini said. ""You can call your guitar whatever you want, just so long as you practice.""
My voice shaking, I told him that I had absolutely no interest in mastering the guitar. What I really wanted was to sing in the voice of Billie Holiday. ""Mainly commercials, but not for any banks or car dealerships, because those are usually choral arrangements.""
The color ebbed from my teacher's face.
I told him I'd been working up an act and could use a little accompaniment. Did he know the jingle for the new Sara Lee campaign?
""You want me to what?"" He wasn't angry, just confused.
I felt certain he was lying when he denied knowing the tune. Doublemint gum, Ritz crackers, the theme songs for Alka-Seltzer and Kenmore appliances: He claimed ignorance on all counts. I started in on an a cappella version of the latest Oscar Mayer commercial, hoping he might join in once the spirit moved him. It looked bad, I knew, but in order to sustain the proper mood, I needed to disregard his company and sing the way I did at home when alone in my bedroom, my eyes shut tight and my hands dangling like pointless, empty gloves.
My bologna has a first name, it's O-S-C-A-R
My bologna has a second name, it's M-A-Y-E-R
Oh, I love to eat it every day
And if you ask me why I'll say
'Cause Oscar Mayer has a way with B-O-L-O-G-N-A.
I reached the end of my tune thinking he might take this as an opportunity to applaud or even apologize for underestimating me. Mild amusement would have been an acceptable response, but instead he held up his hands, as if to stop an advancing car. ""Hey, guy,"" he said. ""You can hold it right there. I'm not into that scene.""
A scene? What scene? I thought I was being original.
""There were plenty of screwballs like you back in Atlanta, but me, I don't swing that way--you got it? This might be your 'thing' or whatever, but you can definitely count me out."" He reached for his conch shell and stubbed out his cigarette. ""I mean, come on now. For God's sake, kid, pull yourself together.""
I knew then why I'd never sung in front of anyone and why I shouldn't have done it in front of Mister Mancini. He'd used the word screwball, but I knew what he really meant. He meant I should have named my guitar Doug or Brian or, better yet, taken up the flute. He meant that if we're defined by our desires, I was in for a lifetime of trouble.
The remainder of the hour was spent awkwardly watching the clock as we silently pretended to tune our guitars.
My father was disappointed when I told him I wouldn't be returning for any more lessons. ""He told me not to come back,"" I said. ""He told me I have the wrong kind of fingers."" Seeing that it had worked for me, my sisters invented similar stories, and together we announced that the Sedaris Trio had officially disbanded. Our father offered to find us better teachers, adding that if we were unhappy with our instruments we could trade them in for something more suitable. ""The trumpet or the saxophone or, hey, how about the vibes?"" He reached for a Lionel Hampton album, saying, ""I want you to sit down and give this a good listen. Just get a load of this cat and tell me he's not an inspiration.""
There was a time when I could listen to such a record and imagine myself as the headline act at some magnificent New York nightclub, but that's what fantasies are for: They allow you to skip the degradation and head straight to the top. I'd done my solo and would now move on to pursue other, equally unsuccessful ways of getting attention. I'd try every art form there was, and with each disappointment I'd picture Mister Mancini holding his conch shell and saying, ""For God's sake, kid, pull yourself together.""
We told our father no, don't bother playing us any more of your records, but he still persisted. ""I'm telling you that this album is going to change your lives, and if it doesn't, I'll give each one of you a five-dollar bill. What do you think of that?""
It was a tough call--five dollars for listening to a Lionel Hampton record. We looked at one another, my sisters and I, and then we left the room, ignoring his cry of ""Hey, where do you think you're going? Get back in here and listen.""
We joined our mother at the TV and never looked back. A life in music was his great passion, not ours, and our lessons had taught us that without the passion, the best we could hope for was an occasional engagement at some hippie wedding where, if we were lucky, the guests would be too stoned to realize just how bad we really were. That night, as was his habit, our father fell asleep in front of the stereo, the record making its pointless, silent rounds as he laid back against the sofa cushions, dreaming."

Let the sunshine in (Open up your heart)

1970^"""A Boy Named Sue"""^Johnny Cash^Male^"""I'd love to!""
""One of the greatest guitar players as well as songwriters and singers in the business. Appreciate a little help on the guitar, all right?""

Well, my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""

Well, he must've thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folks
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile
And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!"
1970^"""Is That All There Is?"""^Peggy Lee^Female^"Our house caught on fire
I'll never forget the look on my father's face
As he gathered me up in his arms
And raced through the burning building onto the pavement
And I stood there shivering in my pajamas
And watched the whole world go up in flames
And when it was all over I said to myself
""Is that all there is to a fire?""

Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
And when I was  years old
My daddy took me to the circus,
The greatest show on earth
There were clowns and elephants, dancing bears
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads
As I sat there watching
I had the feeling that something was missing
I don't know what
When it was all over I said to myself
""Is that all there is to the circus?""
Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
And then I fell in love
With the most wonderful boy in the world
We'd take long walks down by the river
Or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes
We were so very much in love
Then one day he went away
And I thought I'd die, but I didn't
And when I didn't, I said to myself
""Is that all there is to love?""
Is that all there is? is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep...
I know what you must be saying to yourselves
""If that's the way she feels about it, why doesn't she just end it all?""
Oh, no. Not me
I'm not ready for that final disappointment
Cause I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you
And when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath,
I'll be saying to myself
Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is"

1970^"""Spinning Wheel"""^Blood, Sweat & Tears^Unknown^"What goes up must come down
Spinnin' wheel got to go 'round
Talkin' 'bout your troubles it's a cryin' sin
Ride a painted pony let the spinnin' wheel spin

You got no money and you got no home
Spinnin' wheel all alone
Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you never learn
Ride a painted pony let the spinnin' wheel turn

Did you find the directing sign on the
Straight and narrow highway
Would you mind a reflecting sign
Just let it shine within your mind
And show you the colors that are real

Someone is waiting just for you
Spinnin' wheel, spinnin' true
Drop all your troubles by the riverside
Catch a painted pony on the spinning wheel ride

Someone is waiting just for you
Spinnin' wheel, spinnin' true
Drop all your troubles by the riverside
Ride a painted pony let the spinning wheel fly
"
1971^"""Bridge over Troubled Water"""^Simon & Garfunkel^Male^"When you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on Silver Girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine, oh
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind"
1971^"""(They Long to Be) Close to You"""^The Carpenters^Unknown^"(Presenta di grand circo
La prima del mondo
La grand successo
Giuliano di Vittorio
Fantastico
Magnifico
Spectaculario)
(Here Alice ventured to interrupt
""It's very long,"" she said as politely as she could
""Would you tell me first which road?""
Tweedledum smiled gently and began again)

The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all his might
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night

The moon was shining sulkily
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done
""It's very rude of him,"" she said
""To come and spoil the fun""
The sea was wet as wet could be
The sands were dry as dry
You could not see a cloud because
No cloud was in the sky
No birds were flying o'erhead
There were no birds to fly

The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand
""If this were only cleared away
They said, ""It would be grand""

""If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year
Do you suppose,"" the Walrus said
""That they could get it clear?""
""I doubt it,"" said the Carpenter
And shed a bitter tear

""O, Oysters, come and walk with us""
The Walrus did beseech
""A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk
Along the briny beach
We cannot do with more than four
To give a hand to each""
The eldest Oyster looked at him
But never a word he said
The eldest Oyster winked his eye
And shook his heavy head
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster bed

(Alright? You ready? Okay
A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four
But four young Oysters hurried up
All eager for the treat
A four young ... you gotta use the chord ... oh
'Cause you gotta go clang
One, two ... okay ...clang ...  okay
A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four)

But four young Oysters hurried up
All eager for their treat
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed
Their shoes were clean and neat
And this was odd because, you know
They hadn't any feet
Four other Oysters followed them
And yet another four
And thick and fast they came at last
And more, and more, and more
All hopping through the frothy waves
And scrambling to the shore

The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row

""The time has come,"" the Walrus said
""To talk of many things
Of shoes, and ships and sealing wax
Of cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot
And whether pigs have wings""

(But wait a bit
It's alight, we'll let you start
But wait a bit
Ah, c'mon, get it together, man
C'mon
One, two, three)

""But wait a bit,"" the Oysters cried
""Before we have our chat
For some of us are out of breath
And all of us are fat""
""No hurry,"" said the Carpenter
They thanked him much for that

""A loaf of bread,"" the Walrus said
""Is what we chiefly need
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear
We can begin to feed""

""Not on us,"" the Oysters cried
Turning a little blue
""After such kindness that would be
A dismal thing to do""
""The night is fine,"" the Walrus said
""Do you admire the view?""

""It was so kind of you to come
And you are very nice""
The Carpenter said nothing but
""Cut us another slice
I wish you were not quite so deaf
I've had to ask you twice""

""It seems a shame,"" the Walrus said
""To play them such a trick
After we've brought them out so far
And made them trot so quick""
The Carpenter said nothing but
""The butter's spread too thick""

""I weep for you,"" the Walrus said
""I deeply sympathize""
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size
Holding his pocket handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes

""O, Oysters,"" said the Carpenter
""You've had a pleasant run
Shall we be trotting home again?""
But answer came there none
And this was scarcely odd because
They'd eaten every one
They'd eaten every one"
1971^"""Everything Is Beautiful"""^Ray Stevens^Male^"Jesus loves the little children
All the little children of the world
Red and yellow, black and white
They are precious in his sight
Jesus loves the little children of the world
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer night
Or a snow covered winter's day
Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

There is none so blind
That is he who will not see
We must not close our minds
We must let our thought be free
For every hour that passes by
You know the world
Gets a little bit older
It's time to realize
That beauty lies
In the eyes of the beholder
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights
Or a snow covered winter's day
Ah, sing it, children
Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

We shouldn't care
About the length of his hair
Or the color of his skin
Don't worry about what shows from without
But the love that lives within
We're gonna get it all together now
Everything gonna work out fine
Just take a little time
To look on the good side my friend
And straighten it out in your mind

Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights
Or a snow covered winter's day
Ah, sing it, children
Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way
One more time
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights"
1971^"""Fire and Rain"""^James Taylor^Male^"Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now"
1971^"""Let It Be"""^The Beatles^Unknown^"When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be"
1972^"""It's Too Late"""^Carole King^Female^"Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing
Or maybe we just stopped trying

And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh no no no no (no no, no no)

It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool

And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (we can't make it)
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Ohhhh, nooo no
{Instrumental}
(Do do do do do do do do doooo do dooooo dahhhhh)
There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it, too
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you

But it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (we can't make it)
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
Ohhhh, nooo no no no no

It's too late, baby
It's too late, now darlin'
It's too late"

This is the life that I fight for
You are the one that I die for
I'm not giving up, on you on us
See me I'm gonna try more
More than I did in the past time
Them whores you know they dont last long
After the cash
A dick in they ass
And I'm kicking them fast to the sidewalk and I'm gone
I'm gone
My life it is moving along
'Cause once we met our eyes they locked
No regrets, can't stop it, my lord, oh no
Oh no
Everybody voicing opinions
They minions
Disagree with me for you it's true
And you know they could suck a big one
A big one
A motherfucking big one
They treating you like a victim of the diction
That I spit when I get my sights on
Something that could flip my lights on
Someone to bring home to my mom and my dad
I like that
Wanna try some
Not giving a fuck about what they say
Dont give a fuck whats in my way
I'm a take that chick on her wedding day
Get away and see better days
From Hamburg

Yeah it's all for you (yeah)
All I do, all I do
For you, for you

This is the path that I chose
This my life
This how it goes
I tried to do right with two in sight
Met you that night and heaven knows
You're everything I ever looked for
Every box on my list you can cross off
We a perfect match
Ever heard of that?
Roberta Flack she spot on
The first time
The first time
Saw your face it paused time
Radically was attracting me and I can't believe you're all mine
All mine, oh my
Everybody is warning you of my story
But you can afford to to turn and ignore
'Cause you already know that you were made just for me
For me
You were made just for me
Fucked up my life
Searching for a wife
You turned it all right when you called me
You had your own life with a man and a crib
Had a career
Handled your shit
You tore it all down
Dismantled it quick
Once you saw what happiness is
Broke it apart
Started anew
Time to restart and depart into blue
Making it hard
Harder for you
Can't disregard what the heart is into
Partial to you
Stand at your side
Either get with us or tell us good bye
Advising against me but they gonna find
They'll be eating their words while you and me fly
I do it for you (yeah I do it for you)
It's all for you (yeah it's all for you)
All I do (all I do, all I do)
It's all for you (you, for you)
It's true

Yes it's true (yes its true, yes its true)
All I do (all I do, yeah I do)
I do
I do for you"
1973^"""Alone Again (Naturally)"""^Gilbert O'Sullivan^Male^"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people saying
""My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining""
""We may as well go home""
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
All about God and His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me
In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that
There are more hearts
Broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?

Alone again, naturally
Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally"
1973^"""American Pie"""^Don McLean^Male^"A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock 'n roll
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

Oh, and there we were, all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die...""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

And they were singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

They were singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die..."""

When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

Embarrassed by the crowd

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

And then he looked right through me
As if I wasn't there

You walked into the party
Like you were walking onto a yacht

They'd be your partner

You're so vain
I'll bet you think this song is about you
Don't you? Don't you? Don't you?

You had me several years ago
When I was still quite naive
Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee, and
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
I'll bet you think this song is about you

And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your Learjet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Well, you're where you should be all the time
And when you're not, you're with
Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend, and
You're so vain
You probably think this song is about you
You're so vain
I'll bet you think this song is about you

That I never thought I would
But I believe you really ought to know

I love you
I honestly love you

You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid

This is pure and simple
And you must realise
That it's coming from my heart
And not my head

I love you
I honestly love you
I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all

But this feeling doesn't come along
Everyday
And you shouldn't blow the chance
When you've got the chance to say

I love you
(I love you)
I honestly love you

If we both were born in another place and time
This moment might be ending in a kiss

But there you are with yours
And here I am with mine
So I guess we'll just be leaving it at this

I love you
I honestly love you
I honestly love you"
1975^"""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"""^Elton John^Male^"I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeah
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me"
1975^"""Feel Like Makin' Love"""^Roberta Flack^Female^"Strollin' in the park
Watchin' winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark
Seein' lovers do their thing

Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you
That's the time
I feel like makin' dreams come true
Oh, baby

When you talk to me
When you're moanin' sweet and low
When you're touchin' me
And my feelings start to show


In a restaurant
Holdin' hands by candlelight
While I'm touchin' you
Wanting you with all my might

Strollin' in the park
Watchin' winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark
Seein' lovers do their thing
Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you"
1975^"""Help Me"""^Joni Mitchell^Female^"Help me, I think I'm falling in love again
When I get that crazy feeling, I know I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble 'cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet taIking ladies man

And you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom

Help me, I think I'm falling in love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash

We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom

Didn't it feel good, we were sitting there talking?
Or lying there not talking, didn't it feel good?
You dance with the lady with the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good, didn't it feel good?
Help me, I think I'm falling in love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself?
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around flirting and flirting, hurting too

We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom"
1975^"""Midnight at the Oasis"""^Maria Muldaur^Female^"Midnight at the oasis
Send your camel to bed
Shadows painting our faces
Traces of romance in our heads
Heaven's holding a half moon
Shining just for us
Let's slip off to
A sand dune, real soon
And kick up a little dust

Come on, cactus is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come on, 'til the evening ends
'Til the evening ends

You don't have to answer
There's no need to speak
I'll be your belly dancer, prancer
And you can be my sheik


I know your daddy's a sultan
A nomad known to all
With fifty girls to attend him
They all send him
Jump at his beck and call
But you won't need no harem, honey
When I'm by your side
And you won't need no camel, no no
When I take you for a ride

Come on, cactus is our friend
He'll point out the way
Come on, 'til the evening ends
'Til the evening ends

Midnight at the oasis
Send your camel to bed
Got shadows painting our faces
And traces of romance in our heads

Oh come on, oh come on
Woo hoo hoo, yeah, oh yeah"
1976^"""Love Will Keep Us Together"""^Captain & Tennille^Unknown^"Love
Love will keep us together
Think of me, babe whenever
Some sweet talking girl comes along
Singing his song
Don't mess around
You just got to be strong

Just stop
Cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together

You
You belong to me now
Ain't gonna set you free now
When those girls start hanging around
Talking me down
Hear with your heart
And you won't hear a sound

Just stop
Cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together
Young and beautiful
Someday your looks will be gone
When the others turn you off
Who'll be turnin' you on
I will, I will, I will
I will, be there to share forever
Love will keep us together
I said it before
And I'll say it again
While others pretend
I need you now and I need you then

Just stop
Cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together
Whatever
Whatever, I will, I will, I will, I will
You better stop
Cause I really love you
Stop, I've been thinkin' of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together
Whatever
Whatever, I will, I will, I will"
1976^"""At Seventeen"""^Janis Ian^Female^"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

A brown-eyed girl in hand-me-downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity, please, the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve""
And the rich-relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly
Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen


To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
They call and say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me
At seventeen"
1976^"""Lyin' Eyes"""^Eagles^Unknown^"City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

Late at night, a big, old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has it's price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
She is headed for the cheatin' side of town

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

On the other side of town, a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night, anticipating
Because he makes her feel the way she used to feel
She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that, soon, she'll be comin' back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool

My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things?
You're still the same old girl you used to be
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes"
1976^"""Mandy"""^Barry Manilow^Male^"I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me

Oh, Mandy
Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy
I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes
And nothing is rhyming

Oh, Mandy
Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy

Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on a breeze
The pain is calling

Oh, Mandy
Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy
Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you"
1976^"""Rhinestone Cowboy"""^Glen Campbell^Male^"Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone
Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know"
1977^"""This Masquerade"""^George Benson^Male^"Are we really happy here with this lonely game we play?
Looking for words to say
Searching but not finding understanding anywhere
We're lost in a masquerade
Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play
Thoughts of leaving disappear every time I see your eyes
No matter how hard I try
To understand the reasons why we carry on this way
We're lost in a masquerade

1977^"""Afternoon Delight"""^Starland Vocal Band^Unknown^"Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been ""when it's right, it's right""
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?

When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway

Thinking of you's working up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbing sticks and stones together, make the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbing you is getting so exciting

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always thought a fish could not be caught who didn't bite
But you got some bait awaiting and I think I might
Like nibbling a little afternoon delight
Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around
We can make a lot of loving 'fore the sun gone down

Thinking of you's working up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbing sticks and stones together, make the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbing you is getting so exciting

Skyrockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again""
I said ""I appreciate that, and would you please explain
About the  ways?""
She said, ""Why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light""

I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make the young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs

My home lies deep within you
And I've got my own place in your soul

I'm young again, even though I'm very old

I write the songs that make the young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs

Oh, my music makes you dance
And gives your spirit to take a chance
And I wrote some rock 'n' roll so you can move
Music fills your heart, well, that's a real fine place to start
It's from me, it's for you
It's from you, it's from me
It's a worldwide symphony

1978^"""Hotel California"""^Eagles^Unknown^"On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here
Since ""
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice, and she said
""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave""

1978^"""Blue Bayou"""^Linda Ronstadt^Female^"
I feel so bad I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou

Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be
Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickels saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou

Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

Oh that boy of mine
By my side
The silver moon
And the evening tide
Oh some sweet day
Gonna take away
This hurting inside

Well I'll never be blue
My dreams come true

You've found someone new
And don't it make my brown eyes blue

I'll just cry all night long, say it isn't true
And don't it make my brown eyes blue
Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies
Give me no reasons, give me alibis
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye
I didn't mean to treat you bad
Didn't know just what I had
But honey now I do

Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed

Ageless and ever, ever, ever, evergreen"
1978^"""You Light Up My Life"""^Debby Boone^Female^"So many nights
I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone
To sing me his song
So many dreams
I've kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark
But now you've come along

And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song

Rolling at sea
Adrift on the water
Could it be finally
I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance
To say, ""Hey, I love you,""
Never again
To be all alone

It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you
You light up my life"

And I don't see you anymore

I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far, mmm
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go tryin' some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair, mmm
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard, mmm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
Oh, what will it take 'til you believe in me
The way that I believe in you?
I said I love you, and that's forever
And this I promise from the heart, mmm
I couldn't love you any better
I love you just the way you are
Alright!

1979^"""Baker Street"""^Gerry Rafferty^Male^"
Windin' your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day, you'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
And it's taking you so long to find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin', you're tryin' now
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now


Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen and you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down, in some quiet little town
And forget about everything
But you know he'll always keep movin'
You know he's never gonna stop movin'
'Cause he's rollin', he's the rollin' stone
And when you wake up, it's a new mornin'
The sun is shinin', it's a new mornin'
You're goin', you're goin' home

And felt this pain
That I have known
Because I needed just to hear
That special something
And then one day
You just appear
You said ""hello""
""Let's make love along the way""
Your name is music to my heart
I'll always really love you
Feel so good when I'm with you
I can't believe you love me too
With you it feels like it should feel
With you it feels so good"

1979^"""You Needed Me"""^Anne Murray^Female^"I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares
You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
You needed me, you needed me"
1980^"""What a Fool Believes"""^The Doobie Brothers^Unknown^"He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize it never really was

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all

Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
(If love can come and love can go, then why can't love return once more?)
Is always better than nothing
(Who got the power?)
Than nothing at all (Oh, now)
What a fool believes
(I believe she's never gone away) he sees
No wise man has the power (to reason away)
To reason away
What seems to be
(Oh, if love can come and love can go, oh, mama)
Is always better than nothing (better than nothing)
Than nothing at all (oh, I believe)"
1980^"""After the Love Has Gone"""^Earth, Wind & Fire^Unknown^"For awhile, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew
In our eyes, we're alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night, something right
Would invite us to begin the day

Something happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Something happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had

And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

For awhile, to love each other with all
We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Oh, baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had
'Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared
This affair would lead our love in two
Something happened along the way
Yesterday was all we had
Something happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Something happened along the way
Oh, and yesterday was all we had

And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
After the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?"
1980^"""The Gambler"""^Kenny Rogers^Male^"On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So, if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right""

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep
And when he finished speakin'
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em)
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done"
1990^"""Wind Beneath My Wings"""^Bette Midler^Female^"Oh, oh, oh, oh

It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you
Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

Fly, fly, so high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky
Thank you, thank you
Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings"
1990^"""The End of the Innocence"""^Don Henley^Male^"And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by
But ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly
Oh, but I know a place where we can go
Still untouched by men
Sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind
You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
O' beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie
Oh, but I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast
But, somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
Oh nah nah
Naaah"
1990^"""The Living Years"""^Mike + The Mechanics^Unknown^"Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door
I know that I'm a prisoner to all my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage, to all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got
You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence

Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye
So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts
So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be okay

Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye

I wasn't there that morning
When my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say
I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him
In the living years

Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye"
1990^"""She Drives Me Crazy"""^Fine Young Cannibals^Unknown^"
I can't stop the way I feel
Things you do don't seem real
Tell me what you've got in mind
Cause we're running out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waiting 'round's killing me

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me there's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be alone

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy

Is there somewhere you can tell me?""

He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

Think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk, but she's trying

Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for
You and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise
Just think about it

Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for

It's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man

And no one is in need
And there are no guns, no bombs and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed

We are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope
Playing songs of peace
They are the songs of every man
God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us

From a distance
You look like my friend
Even though we are at war

I just cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for

I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing... I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me?
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost, and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up
Consider this
Consider this the hint of the century
Consider this the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around?
And now, I've said
Too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try?
That was just a dream, just a dream
Just a dream, dream"
1992^"""Something to Talk About"""^Bonnie Raitt^Female^"People are talking, talking 'bout people
I hear them whisper, you won't believe it
They think we're lovers kept under cover
I just ignore it, but they keep saying
We laugh just a little too loud
Stand just a little too close
We stare just a little too long
Maybe they're seein' something we don't, darling

Let's give 'em something to talk about
Let's give 'em something to talk about
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about love?

I feel so foolish, I never noticed
You'd act so nervous, could you be falling for me?
It took the rumor to make me wonder
Now I'm convinced I'm going under
Thinkin' 'bout you every day
Dream 'bout you every night
I'm hoping that you feel the same way
Now that we know it, let's really show it, darling
Let's give 'em something to talk about
A little mystery to figure out, babe
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about love?
Let's give 'em something to talk about, babe
A little mystery to figure out
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about love?
Ooh, listen to 'em baby
A little mystery won't hurt 'em
Let's give 'em something to talk about
How about our love, love, love, love"
1993^"""Tears in Heaven"""^Eric Clapton^Male^"Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
‘Cause I know I don't belong
Here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
‘Cause I know I just can't stay
Here in heaven

Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please
Begging please


Beyond the door, there's peace, I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more
Tears in heaven
Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would you be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I don't belong
Here in heaven"
1993^"""Achy Breaky Heart"""^Billy Ray Cyrus^Male^"You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes when I'm gone
Or you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone
You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh

You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today
But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh


Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart

Neither one prepared

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you
Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see
But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing

I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on the radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow, turnin' you round and round
And if you said, ""This life ain't good enough""
I'd give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town

2011^"""Love the Way You Lie"""^Eminem featuring Rihanna^Female^"He unsuccessfully tries to kiss the woman and brings her back after she attempts to leave him. The man then pushes her onto the wall and aims his fist at her, puncturing the wall instead. After Rihanna sings again, the video flashes back to when the couple first meet ""at a seedy dive bar next door"" to a liquor store. The man steals a bottle of vodka and they kiss on the rooftop
During the present, the man apologizes to his lover and they are reconciled. In another flashback, he attacks someone who plays pool with his lover. Eminem joins Rihanna in front of the burning house for the final verse. Meanwhile, after the flashback, the woman comes home and locks herself in the bathroom to stop her abusive lover from entering
In another scene, the fire on her palms vanish as she clasps her hands. Flames later engulf Eminem and the couple, who are then shown fighting in front of the burning house. In the end, the couple stay together and the video returns to their first scene, in which they sleep"

I know you feel where I'm comin' from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

2012^"""The Cave"""^Mumford & Sons^Unknown^"It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind
The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again"

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe,""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""awe, awe, awe""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night

You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it, friend, it's on its head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

Third and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me ""Lip Parade""
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent
Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles
Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I, and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now, to know it in my memory

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles"

Mesela çok mutlu olduğunu hatta mutluluktan ölebileceğini söylediğin zamanları
Kendime senin benim için doğru olan kişi olduğunu söyledim
Ama seninle birlikteliğimde çok yalnız hissettim
Ama bu aşktı ve hala hatırladığım bir acıydı

Üzüntünün belli bir haline bağımlı olabilirsin
Mesela sona boyun eğmek her zaman sonu getirir
O yüzden beraber bir anlama gelmediğimizi anladığımızda
Yani, hala arkadaş kalabileceğimizi söylemiştin
Ama itiraf edeyim, bittiğine çok sevinmiştim

Ama beni kesip atmana gerеk yoktu
Bunlar hiç yaşanmamış ve hiçbir şey değilmişiz gibi davranmana gеrek yoktu
Ve aşkına ihtiyacım bile yok
Ama bana sanki bir yabancıymışım gibi davranıyorsun ve bu bana çok koyuyor
Hayır, kendini bu kadar alçaltmana gerek yoktu
Arkadaşlarına bendeki eşyalarını toplattırıp sonra da numaranı değiştirdin
Ve sanırım buna da ihtiyacım yok
Şimdi sen benim sadece eskiden tanıdığım birisin
Şimdi sen benim sadece eskiden tanıdığım birisin
Şimdi sen benim sadece eskiden tanıdığım birisin
Şu aralar beni mahvettiğin tüm o anları düşünüyorum
Ama beni, bunu her zaman benim yaptığım bir şey olduğuna inandırdın
Ama ben bu şekilde yaşamak istemiyorum
Söylediğin her sözün altında bir anlam aramak
Bunu boş verebileceğini söyledin
Ve ben de seni eskiden tanıdığın birine kafayı takmış halde yakalamazdım

Ama beni kesip atmana gerek yoktu
Bunlar hiç yaşanmamış ve hiçbir şey değilmişiz gibi davranmana gerek yoktu (Ahhh)

Le présent n'a pas de rythme

Quelle est cette chose que je ressens ?
Si tu veux partir, je te suis

Nous sommes allés trop loin pour renoncer à ce que nous sommes
Alors mettons la barre plus haut et levons nos verres jusqu'aux étoiles

Ei, ei, ei, ei, ei, ei, ei, ei, ei, todo mundo levante-se
Todo mundo levante-se, wo, ligue-me

Se você não consegue ouvir o que estou tentando dizer
Se você não consegue ler a partir da mesma página
Talvez eu esteja ficando surdo, talvez eu esteja ficando cego
Talvez eu esteja fora de controle

Ok, agora que ele estava perto, tentei te domesticar
Mas você é uma animal, baby, está na sua natureza
Apenas deixe-me libertar você
Você não precisa de nenhum documento
Aquele homem não é o seu companheiro
E é por isso que vou pegar uma

Boa menina! Eu sei que você quer, eu sei que você quer
Eu sei que você quer
Você é uma boa menina! Não vou deixá-la ganhar de mim
E me abandonar em um plástico falando que está sobrecarregada
Eu odeio essas linhas borradas! Eu sei que você quer
Eu sei que você quer, eu sei que você quer
Mas você é uma boa menina! O jeito que você me agarra
Devo querer ficar safado, vá em frente, chegue perto de mim
Para que eles fazem sonhos quando você usa esses jeans
Para que precisamos ir a todo o vapor?
Você é a vadia mais quente neste lugar!

Me sinto tão sortudo, você quer me abraçar
O que rima com me abraça? Ei

Ok, agora que ele estava perto, tentei te domesticar
Mas você é uma animal, baby, está na sua natureza
Apenas deixe-me libertar você
Você não precisa de nenhum documento
Aquele homem não é o seu companheiro
E é por isso que vou te pegar

Boa menina! Eu sei que você quer, eu sei que você quer
Eu sei que você quer
Você é uma boa menina! Não vou deixá-la ganhar de mim
E me abandonar em um plástico falando que está sobrecarregada
Eu odeio essas linhas borradas! Eu sei que você quer
Eu sei que você quer, eu sei que você quer
Mas você é uma boa menina! O jeito que você me agarra
Devo querer ficar safado, vá em frente, chegue perto de mim
Uma coisa que eu peço a você
Deixe-me ser aquele para quem você levanta essa bunda
De Malibu a Paris, u
Tive uma vadia mas ela não é ruim como você
Então, me alcance quando você passar
Vou te dar algo grande o suficiente
Para rasgar sua bunda em duas
Tem estilo mesmo quando você se veste casual
Quero dizer, é quase insuportável
Querida, você não está lá quando eu estou
No lado da barra deixo você me ter
Nada como o último cara, ele é muito antiquado para você
Ele não bate nessa a bunda e puxa seu cabelo para você
Então, eu estou apenas assistindo e esperando
Para você cumprimentar o verdadeiro cafetão
Muitas mulheres não conseguem recusar este cafetão
Sou um cara legal, mas não se confunda, você está nisso!

Mexa sua traseira, abaixe, levante-se
Faça como se doesse, como se doesse
O que, você não gosta de trabalho? Ei

Baby, você pode respirar? Consegui isso na Jamaica
Sempre funciona comigo, Dakota a Decatur
Não vamos mais fingir porque agora é sua vitória
Aqui está o nosso começo, eu sempre quis ter uma

Boa menina! Eu sei que você quer
Eu sei que você quer, eu sei que você quer

Você é uma boa menina! Não vou deixá-la ganhar de mim
E me abandonar em um plástico
Falando que está sobrecarregada

Eu odeio essas linhas borradas! Eu sei que você quer
Eu sei que você quer, eu sei que você quer

Mas você é uma boa menina! O jeito que você me agarra
Devo querer ficar safado, vá em frente, chegue perto de mim

Todo mundo, levante-se, todo mundo, levante-se
Todo mundo, levante-se

I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse

Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type

Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal

But she won't sing this song

Tall time to call your Ma

Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well, you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light

I waited outside
I was tokin' on dope
I hoped it all wunt go in a minute
With the past that you know
I wanted all that mind sugar
I want it all mine
I had a heavy mind, sugar
I took it, it was right

You're back and forth
You're back and forth
You go back and forth
And then you're back and forth
And back and forth

I waited outside
Then you took me in the room
And you offered up the truth
My eyes crawling up the window to the wall
From dusk 'til dawn
Let me talk to 'em
Let me talk to 'em all
