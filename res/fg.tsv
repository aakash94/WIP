1961	"""Theme from A Summer Place"""	Male	Percy Faith	"Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care
For it knows
There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love
And the sweet secret of
A summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes
All their dreams
All their love
And the sweet secret of a summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes
All their dreams, all their love1Embed"
1961	"""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"""	Male	Elvis Presley	"Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you are lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage and each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why, I've never known
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?5Embed"

1961	"""Mack the Knife"""	Female	Ella Fitzgerald	"And he shows them pearly white
Just a jack-knife has Mac-heath, dear
And he keeps it out of sight
When the shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves though wears Mac-heath, dear
So there's not a trace, not a trace of red
On the sidewalk on a Sunday morning
Lies a body oozing life
Someone's sneaking 'round that corner
Tell me could it be, could it be Mack the Knife
On a tugboat down by the river, don't you know
A cement bag's dropping down
The cement's just for the weight, dear
Bet you that cat called Mack-heath, oh Mack-heath, he's back in town

For us to fall in love
Hey baby, what's your hurry?
Relax and don't you worry
We're gonna fall in love

1962	"""Big Bad John"""	Male	Jimmy Dean	"(Big John)
(Big John)

Ev'ry mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six foot six and weighed two forty five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew, ya didn't give no lip to Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, he kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, he just said, ""Hi"" to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land, Big John
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant Oak tree, he just stood there alone, Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out, ""There's a light up above""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, Big John
With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John

(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Now they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man, Big John

1962	"""The Second Time Around"""	Male	Frank Sinatra	"Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet love comes but once and yet
I'm oh so glad we met the second time around
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found
There are those who'll bet love comes but once and yet
I'm oh so glad we met the second time aroundEmbed"
1962	"""Take Five"""	Unknown	The Dave Brubeck Quartet	"""WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING YOUR GUITAR, MAKE BELIEVE YOU'RE PLAYING AN ACTUAL WOMAN,"" MISTER MANCINI TOLD ME. ""GRAB HER BY THE NECK AND MAKE HER HOLLER.""
My father loves jazz and has an extensive collection of records and reel-to-reel tapes he used to enjoy after returning home from work. He might have entered the house in a foul mood, but once he had his Dexter Gordon and a vodka martini, the stress melted away and everything was ""Beautiful, baby, just beautiful."" The instant the needle hit that record, he'd loosen his tie and become something other than the conservative engineer with a pocketful of IBM pencils embossed with the command think.
""Man, oh man, will you get a load of the chops on this guy? I saw him once at the Blue Note, and I mean to tell you that he blew me right out of my chair! A talent like that comes along only once in a lifetime. The guy was an absolute comet, and there I was in the front row. Can you imagine that?""
""Gee,"" I'd say. ""I bet that was really interesting.""
Empathy was the wrong tack, as it seemed only to irritate him.
""You don't know the half of it,"" my father would say. "" 'Really interesting' my butt. You haven't got a clue. You could have taken a hatchet and cut the man's lips right off his face, chopped them off at the quick, and he still would have played better than anyone else out there. That's how good he was.""
Because it was the music we'd grown up with, I liked to think that my sisters and I had a genuine appreciation for jazz. We preferred it over the music our friends were listening to, yet nothing we did or said could convince him of our devotion. Aside from replaying the tune on your own instrument, how could you prove you were really listening? It was as if he expected us to change color at the end of each selection.
Due to his ear and his almost maniacal sense of discipline, I always thought my father would have made an excellent musician. He might have studied the saxophone had he not been born to immigrant parents who considered even pot holders to be an extravagance. They themselves listened only to Greek music, an oxymoron as far as the rest of the world is concerned. Slam its tail in the door of a milk truck and a stray cat could easily yowl out a single certain to top the charts back in Sparta or ThessalonÃ­ki. Jazz was my father's only form of rebellion. It was forbidden in his home, and he appreciated it as though it were his own private discovery. As a young man, he hid his 78's under the sofa bed and regularly snuck off to New York City, where he'd haunt the clubs and consort with goateed hipsters. It was a good life while it lasted. He was in his early forties when the company transferred our family to North Carolina.
""You expect me to live where?"" he'd asked.
The Raleigh winters agreed with him, but he would've gladly traded the temperate climate for a decent radio station. Since he was limited to his record and tape collection, it became his dream that his family might fill the void by someday forming a jazz combo.
His plan took shape the evening he escorted my sisters Lisa and Gretchen and me to the local state university to see Dave Brubeck, who was then touring with his sons. The audience roared when the quartet took the stage, and I leaned back and shut my eyes, pretending the applause was for me. In order to get that kind of attention, you needed a routine that would knock people's socks off. I'd been working on something in private and now began to imagine bringing it to a larger audience. The act consisted of me dressed in a nice shirt and tie and singing a medley of commercial jingles in the voice of Billie Holiday, who was one of my father's favorite singers. For my Raleigh concert, I'd probably open with the number used to promote the town's oldest shopping center. A quick nod to my accompanist, and I'd launch into ""The Excitement of Cameron Village Will Carry You Away."" The beauty of my rendition was that it captured both the joy and the sorrow of a visit to Ellisburg's or JCPenney. This would be followed by such crowd pleasers as ""Winston Tastes Good Like a Cigarette Should"" and the catchy new Coke commercial, ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing.""
I was lost in my fantasy, ignoring Dave Brubeck and coming up for air only when my father elbowed my ribs to ask, ""Are you listening to this? These cats are burning the paint right off the walls!"" The other audience members sat calmly, as if in church, while my father snapped his fingers and bobbed his head low against his chest. People pointed, and when we begged him to sit up and act normal, he cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted out a request for ""Blue Rondo a La Turk.""
Driving home from the concert that night, he drummed his palms against the steering wheel, saying, ""Did you hear that? The guy just gets better every day! He's up there onstage with his kids by his side--the whole lot of them jamming up a storm. Christ almighty, what I wouldn't give for a family like that. You guys should think of putting an act together.""
My sister Lisa coughed up a mouthful of grapefruit soda.
""No, I mean it,"" my father said. ""All you need are some lessons and instruments and I swear to God you'd go right through the roof."" We hoped this was just another of his five-minute ideas, but by the time we reached the house his eyes were still glowing. ""That's exactly what you need to do,"" he said. ""I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner.""
The following afternoon, he bought a baby grand piano. It was a used model that still managed to look imposing, even when positioned on a linoleum floor. We took turns stabbing at the keys, but as soon as the novelty wore off we bolstered it with sofa cushions and turned it into a fort. The piano sat neglected in the traditional sense until my father signed Gretchen up for a series of lessons. Lisa was assigned the flute, and I returned home from a scout meeting one evening to find my instrument leaning against the aquarium in my bedroom.
""Hold on to your hat,"" my father said, ""because here's that guitar you always wanted.""
Surely he had me confused with someone else. While I had regularly petitioned for a brand-name vacuum cleaner, I'd never said anything about wanting a guitar. Nothing about it appealed to me, not even on an aesthetic level. I had my room arranged just so, and the instrument did not fit in with my nautical theme. An anchor, yes. A guitar, no. He wanted me to jam, so I jammed it in my closet, where it remained until he signed me up for a series of private lessons offered at a music shop located on the ground floor of the recently opened North Hills Mall. I fought it as best I could and feigned illness even as he dropped me off for my first appointment.
""But I'm sick,"" I yelled, watching him pull out of the parking lot. ""I have a virus, and besides that, I don't want to play a musical instrument--don't you know anything?""
When it finally sank in that he wasn't coming back, I lugged my guitar into the music store, where the manager led me to my teacher, a perfectly formed midget named Mister Mancini. I was twelve years old at the time, small for my age, and it was startling to find myself locked in a windowless room with a man who barely reached my chest. It seemed wrong that I would be taller than my teacher, but I kept this observation to myself, saying only, ""My father told me to come here. It was all his idea.""
A fastidious dresser stuck in a small, unfashionable town, Mister Mancini wore clothing I recognized from the young-squires department of Hudson Belk. Some nights he favored button-up shirts with clip-on ties, while other evenings I arrived to find him dressed in flared slacks and snug turtleneck sweaters, a swag of love beads hanging from his neck. His arms were manly and covered in coarse, dark hair, while his voice was high and strange, as if it had been recorded and was now being played back at a faster speed.
Not a dwarf but an honest-to-God midget. My fascination was both evident and unwelcome and was nothing he hadn't been subjected to a million times before. He didn't shake my hand, just lit a cigarette and reached for the conch shell he used as an ashtray. Like my father, Mister Mancini assumed that anyone could learn to play the guitar. He had picked it up during a single summer spent in what he called ""Hotlanta, G. A."" This, I knew, was a racy name given to Atlanta, Georgia. ""Now that,"" he said, ""is one classy place if you know where to go."" He grabbed my guitar and began tuning it, holding his head close against the strings. ""Yessiree kid, the girls down on Peachtree are running wild twenty-four hours a day.""
He mentioned a woman named Beth, saying, ""They threw away the mold and shut down the factory after making that one, you know what I mean?""
I nodded my head, having no idea what he was talking about.
""She wasn't much of a cook, but, hey, I guess that's why God invented TV dinners."" He laughed at his little joke and repeated the line about the frozen dinners as if he would use it later in a comedy routine. ""God made TV dinners, yeah, that's good."" He told me he'd named his guitar after Beth. ""Now I can't keep my hands off it!"" he said. ""Seriously, though, it helps if you give your instrument a name. What do you think you'll call yours?""
""Maybe I'll call it Oliver,"" I said. It was the name of my hamster, and I was used to saying it.
Then again, maybe not.
""Oliver?"" Mister Mancini set my guitar on the floor. ""Oliver? What the hell kind of name is that? If you're going to devote yourself to the guitar, you need to name it after a girl, not a guy.""
""Oh, right,"" I said. ""Joan. I'll call it . . . Joan.""
""So tell me about this Joan,"" he said. ""Is she something pretty special?""
Joan was the name of one of my cousins, but it seemed unwise to share this information. ""Oh, yeah,"" I said. ""Joan's really . . . great. She's tall and . . ."" I felt self-conscious using the word tall and struggled to take it back. ""She's small and has brown hair and everything.""
""Is she stacked?""
I'd never noticed my cousin's breasts and was working to conceal the horrible secret that I'd never noticed anyone's breasts, not unless, like our housekeeper's, they were large enough to appear freakish. ""Stacked? Well, sure,"" I said. ""She's pretty stacked."" I was afraid he'd ask me for a more detailed description and was relieved when he crossed the room and removed Beth from her case. He told me that a guitar student needed plenty of discipline. Talent was great, but time had taught him that talent was also extremely rare. ""I've got it,"" he said. ""But then again, I was born with it. It's a gift from God, and those of us who have it are very special people.""
He seemed to know that I was nothing special, just a type, yet another boy whose father had his head in the clouds.
""Do you have a feel for the guitar? Do you have any idea what this little baby is capable of?"" Without waiting for an answer, he climbed up into his chair and began playing ""Light My Fire,"" adding, ""This one is for Joan.""
""You know that it would be untrue,"" he sang. ""You know that I would be a liar."" The little man played beautifully but sang ""Light My Fire"" as if he were a Webelo scout demanding a match. He finished his opening number, nodded his head in acknowledgment of my applause, and moved on, offering up his own unique and unsettling versions of ""The Girl from Ipanema"" and ""Little Green Apples"" while I sat trapped in my seat, my false smile stretched so tight I lost all feeling in the lower half of my face. My fingernails had grown a good three inches by the time he struck his final note and called me close to point out a few simple chords. Before I left, he handed me a half dozen purpled, mimeographed handouts that we both knew were useless.
Back at the house, my mother had my dinner warming in the oven. From the living room came the aimless whisper of Lisa's flute; it sounded not unlike the wind whipping through an empty Pepsi can. Down in the basement, either Gretchen was practicing her piano or the cat was chasing a moth across the keys. My mother responded by turning up the volume on the kitchen TV while my father pushed back my plate, set Joan in my lap, and instructed me to play. ""Listen to this,"" he crowed. ""A house full
of music! Man, this is beautiful.""
You certainly couldn't accuse him of being unsupportive. His enthusiasm bordered on mania, yet still it failed to inspire us. During practice sessions, my sisters and I would eat potato chips, scowling at our hated instruments and speculating on the lives of our music teachers. They were all peculiar in one way or another, but with a midget, I'd definitely won the my-teacher-is-stranger-than-yours competition. I wondered where Mister Mancini lived and who he might call in case of an emergency. Did he stand on a chair in order to shave, or was his home customized to meet his needs? I'd look at the laundry hamper or the beer cooler, thinking that if it came down to it, Mister Mancini could hide just about anywhere. Though I thought of him constantly, I grabbed any excuse to avoid my guitar.
""I've been doing just what you told me to do,"" I'd say at the beginning of each lesson, ""but I just can't get the hang of it. Maybe my fingers are too shor--I mean litt--I mean, maybe I'm just not coordinated enough."" He'd arrange Joan in my lap, pick up Beth, and tell me to follow along. ""You need to believe you're playing an actual woman,"" he'd say. ""Just grab her by the neck and make her holler.""
Mister Mancini had a singular talent for making me uncomfortable. He forced me to consider things I'd rather not think about--the sex of my guitar, for instance. If I honestly wanted to put my hands on a woman, would that automatically mean I could play? Gretchen's teacher never told her to think of her piano as a boy. Neither did Lisa's flute teacher, though in that case the analogy was fairly obvious. On the off chance that sexual desire was all it took, I steered clear of Lisa's instrument, fearing I might be labeled a prodigy. The best solution was to become a singer and leave the instruments to somebody else. A song stylist--that was what I wanted to be.
I was at the mall with my mother one afternoon when I spotted Mister Mancini reaching up to order a hamburger at Scotty's Chuck Wagon, a fast-food restaurant located a few doors down from the music shop. He sometimes mentioned having lunch with a salesgirl from Jolly's Jewelers--""a real looker""--but on this day he was alone. When asking for his hamburger, Mister Mancini had to stand on tiptoe, and even his head failed to reach the counter. The passing adults politely looked away, but their children were decidedly more vocal. A toddler ambled up on his chubby bowed legs, attempting to embrace my teacher with ketchup-smeared fingers while a party of elementary school students openly stared in wonder. Even worse was the group of adolescents, the boys my own age who sat gath-ered around a large table. ""Go back to Oz, munchkin,"" one of them said, and his friends shook with laughter. Tray in hand, Mister Mancini took a seat and pretended not to notice. The boys weren't yelling, but anyone could tell they were making fun of him. ""Honestly, Mother,"" I said. ""Do they have to be such monsters?"" Beneath my moral outrage was a strong sense of possessiveness, a fury that other people were sinking their hooks into my own personal midget. What did they know about this man? I was the one who lit his cigarettes and listened as he denounced the careers of so-called pretty boys such as Glen Campbell and Bobby Goldsboro. It was I who had suffered through six weeks' worth of lessons and was still struggling to master ""Yellow Bird."" If anyone was going to get laughs at his expense, I figured that I should be the first in line.
I'd always thought of Mister Mancini as a blowhard, a pocket playboy, but watching him dip his hamburger into a sad puddle of mayonnaise, I broadened my view and came to see him as a wee outsider, a misfit whose take-it-or-leave-it attitude had left him all alone. This was a persona I'd been tinkering with myself: the outcast, the rebel. It occurred to me that, with the exception of the guitar, he and I actually had quite a bit in common. We were both men trapped inside a boy's body. Each of us was talented in his own way, and we both hated twelve-year-old boys, a demographic group second to none in terms of cruelty. All things considered, there was no reason I shouldn't address him, not as a teacher, but as an artistic brother. Maybe then we could drop the pretense of Joan and get down to work. If things worked out the way I hoped, I'd someday mention in interviews that my accompanist was both my best friend and a midget.
I wore a tie to my next lesson, and this time, when asked if I'd practiced, I told the truth, saying in a matter-of-fact tone of voice that no, I hadn't laid a finger on my guitar since our last get-together. I told him that Joan was my cousin's name and that I had no idea how stacked she was.
""That's okay,"" Mister Mancini said. ""You can call your guitar whatever you want, just so long as you practice.""
My voice shaking, I told him that I had absolutely no interest in mastering the guitar. What I really wanted was to sing in the voice of Billie Holiday. ""Mainly commercials, but not for any banks or car dealerships, because those are usually choral arrangements.""
The color ebbed from my teacher's face.
I told him I'd been working up an act and could use a little accompaniment. Did he know the jingle for the new Sara Lee campaign?
""You want me to what?"" He wasn't angry, just confused.
I felt certain he was lying when he denied knowing the tune. Doublemint gum, Ritz crackers, the theme songs for Alka-Seltzer and Kenmore appliances: He claimed ignorance on all counts. I started in on an a cappella version of the latest Oscar Mayer commercial, hoping he might join in once the spirit moved him. It looked bad, I knew, but in order to sustain the proper mood, I needed to disregard his company and sing the way I did at home when alone in my bedroom, my eyes shut tight and my hands dangling like pointless, empty gloves.
My bologna has a first name, it's O-S-C-A-R
My bologna has a second name, it's M-A-Y-E-R
Oh, I love to eat it every day
And if you ask me why I'll say
'Cause Oscar Mayer has a way with B-O-L-O-G-N-A.
I reached the end of my tune thinking he might take this as an opportunity to applaud or even apologize for underestimating me. Mild amusement would have been an acceptable response, but instead he held up his hands, as if to stop an advancing car. ""Hey, guy,"" he said. ""You can hold it right there. I'm not into that scene.""
A scene? What scene? I thought I was being original.
""There were plenty of screwballs like you back in Atlanta, but me, I don't swing that way--you got it? This might be your 'thing' or whatever, but you can definitely count me out."" He reached for his conch shell and stubbed out his cigarette. ""I mean, come on now. For God's sake, kid, pull yourself together.""
I knew then why I'd never sung in front of anyone and why I shouldn't have done it in front of Mister Mancini. He'd used the word screwball, but I knew what he really meant. He meant I should have named my guitar Doug or Brian or, better yet, taken up the flute. He meant that if we're defined by our desires, I was in for a lifetime of trouble.
The remainder of the hour was spent awkwardly watching the clock as we silently pretended to tune our guitars.
My father was disappointed when I told him I wouldn't be returning for any more lessons. ""He told me not to come back,"" I said. ""He told me I have the wrong kind of fingers."" Seeing that it had worked for me, my sisters invented similar stories, and together we announced that the Sedaris Trio had officially disbanded. Our father offered to find us better teachers, adding that if we were unhappy with our instruments we could trade them in for something more suitable. ""The trumpet or the saxophone or, hey, how about the vibes?"" He reached for a Lionel Hampton album, saying, ""I want you to sit down and give this a good listen. Just get a load of this cat and tell me he's not an inspiration.""
There was a time when I could listen to such a record and imagine myself as the headline act at some magnificent New York nightclub, but that's what fantasies are for: They allow you to skip the degradation and head straight to the top. I'd done my solo and would now move on to pursue other, equally unsuccessful ways of getting attention. I'd try every art form there was, and with each disappointment I'd picture Mister Mancini holding his conch shell and saying, ""For God's sake, kid, pull yourself together.""
We told our father no, don't bother playing us any more of your records, but he still persisted. ""I'm telling you that this album is going to change your lives, and if it doesn't, I'll give each one of you a five-dollar bill. What do you think of that?""
It was a tough call--five dollars for listening to a Lionel Hampton record. We looked at one another, my sisters and I, and then we left the room, ignoring his cry of ""Hey, where do you think you're going? Get back in here and listen.""
We joined our mother at the TV and never looked back. A life in music was his great passion, not ours, and our lessons had taught us that without the passion, the best we could hope for was an occasional engagement at some hippie wedding where, if we were lucky, the guests would be too stoned to realize just how bad we really were. That night, as was his habit, our father fell asleep in front of the stereo, the record making its pointless, silent rounds as he laid back against the sofa cushions, dreaming.1Embed"

J'mettais de la peinture noire sur mes dix doigts
Pour essayer de jouer hallelujah jouer comme toi
Jouer comme ça
Partir avec tous tes disques sur une île
Dans le Chattanooga choo-choo and just for a thrill
I can't stop loving you, me disais-tu
Ben j'peux pas m'arrêter de t'aimer non plus
J'vivrai toujours dans une danger zone
'Cause I feel so bad if you don't leave my woman alone
Et j'vivrai toujours avec Ruby Georgia Marie Ann
Tant qu'y aura ce sacré sun qui gonna shine again
Ray Charles quand tu pleurniches
Les plus pauvres sont les plus riches
Sweet sixteen bars même les plus malheureux
Sont les enfants du Bon Dieu
Ray Charles est-ce que tu le sais ça
On verra le monde comme tu voulais qu'il soit
D'ailleurs on entend déjà les anges jouer comme ça
Jouer comme toi hallelujah
Partir avec tous tes disques sur une île
Dans le Chattanooga choo-choo and just for a thrill
I can't stop loving you, me disais-tu
Ben j'peux pas m'arrêter de t'aimer non plus
J'vivrai toujours dans une danger zone
'Cause I feel so bad if you don't leave my woman alone
Et j'vivrai toujours avec Ruby Georgia Marie Ann

Les mots d'amour les plus doux
Furent prononcés

1963	"""What Kind of Fool Am I?"""	Male	Sammy Davis Jr.	"Who never fell in love
It seems that I'm the only one
That I have been thinking of
What kind of man is this
An empty shell
A lonely cell in which
An empty heart must dwell
What kind of lips are these
That lied with every kiss
That whispered empty words of love
That left me alone like this
Why can't I fall in love
Like any other man
And maybe then I'll know
What kind of fool I am
What kind of clown am I?
What do I know of life?
Why can't I cast away
This mask of play and live my life
Why can't I fall in love
Like any other man
And maybe then I'll know
What kind of fool I amEmbed"

Num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de Ipanema
O seu balançado é mais que um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar

Ah, por que estou tão sozinho?
Ah, por que tudo é tão triste?
Ah, a beleza que existe
A beleza que não é só minha
Que também passa sozinha

Ah, se ela soubesse
Que quando ela passa
O mundo sorrindo se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo por causa do amor

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes ""ah!""

Swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes, each one she passes goes ""ah!""
Oh, but he watches her sadly
How can he tell her he loves her?
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he

To push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you""
""Take me away from here and be my man""

The reflection of my wedding band

To let strange lips lead me on

Could've been a doctor
Could've been a coke boy or a coked up lawyer
Could give up my dreams
Live an average life
But I'm ambitious and my vision ain't a trophy wife


I wanna be a hero
I wanna set examples
I wanna be De Niro
And shoot holes in they temples
Wanna go back in time
And meet some dead people
Wanna be colour blind
Say everybody equal
But I feel hate too
Maybe I hate you
Maybe I don't though
I guess you'll never know
I keep some shit to myself
Some things just don't concern you
And if you don't understand then bitch you better learn to

And Mama hollered out the back door, ""Y'all, remember to wipe your feet!""
And then she said, ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
And Papa said to Mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
Mama said to me, ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all mornin', and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billie Joe was throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round; Papa caught it, and he died last spring

I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""

Then you begin to make it better

By making his world a little colder

1969	"""Honey"""	Male	Bobby Goldsboro	"But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig
Then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from workin' late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show
And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly
And caught her cryin' needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early Spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away
And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could
One day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories of Honey
And I wake up nights and call her name
Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed
That Honey loved
And see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
And I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig1Embed"
1969	"""Wichita Lineman"""	Male	Glen Campbell	"
I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload

I hear you singing in the wire
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line

1970	"""A Boy Named Sue"""	Male	Johnny Cash	"""I'd love to!""
""One of the greatest guitar players as well as songwriters and singers in the business. Appreciate a little help on the guitar, all right?""

Well, my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""

Well, he must've thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folks
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile
And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Anything but Sue! I still hate that name!10Embed"
1970	"""Is That All There Is?"""	Female	Peggy Lee	"Our house caught on fire
I'll never forget the look on my father's face
As he gathered me up in his arms
And raced through the burning building onto the pavement
And I stood there shivering in my pajamas
And watched the whole world go up in flames
And when it was all over I said to myself
""Is that all there is to a fire?""

Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
And when I was 12 years old
My daddy took me to the circus,
The greatest show on earth
There were clowns and elephants, dancing bears
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads
As I sat there watching
I had the feeling that something was missing
I don't know what
When it was all over I said to myself
""Is that all there is to the circus?""
Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
And then I fell in love
With the most wonderful boy in the world
We'd take long walks down by the river
Or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes
We were so very much in love
Then one day he went away
And I thought I'd die, but I didn't
And when I didn't, I said to myself
""Is that all there is to love?""
Is that all there is? is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep...
I know what you must be saying to yourselves
""If that's the way she feels about it, why doesn't she just end it all?""
Oh, no. Not me
I'm not ready for that final disappointment
Cause I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you
And when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath,
I'll be saying to myself
Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is2Embed"

Spinnin' wheel got to go 'round
Talkin' 'bout your troubles it's a cryin' sin
Ride a painted pony let the spinnin' wheel spin

You got no money and you got no home
Spinnin' wheel all alone
Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you never learn
Ride a painted pony let the spinnin' wheel turn

Did you find the directing sign on the
Straight and narrow highway
Would you mind a reflecting sign
Just let it shine within your mind
And show you the colors that are real

Someone is waiting just for you
Spinnin' wheel, spinnin' true
Drop all your troubles by the riverside
Catch a painted pony on the spinning wheel ride

Someone is waiting just for you

Drop all your troubles by the riverside
Ride a painted pony let the spinning wheel fly

Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all

When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on Silver Girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine, oh
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind

Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind24Embed"
1971	"""(They Long to Be) Close to You"""	Unknown	The Carpenters	"(Presenta di grand circo
La prima del mondo
La grand successo

Fantastico
Magnifico
Spectaculario)
(Here Alice ventured to interrupt
""It's very long,"" she said as politely as she could
""Would you tell me first which road?""
Tweedledum smiled gently and began again)

The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all his might
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night

The moon was shining sulkily
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done
""It's very rude of him,"" she said
""To come and spoil the fun""
The sea was wet as wet could be
The sands were dry as dry
You could not see a cloud because
No cloud was in the sky
No birds were flying o'erhead
There were no birds to fly

The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand
""If this were only cleared away
They said, ""It would be grand""

""If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year
Do you suppose,"" the Walrus said
""That they could get it clear?""
""I doubt it,"" said the Carpenter
And shed a bitter tear

""O, Oysters, come and walk with us""
The Walrus did beseech
""A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk
Along the briny beach
We cannot do with more than four
To give a hand to each""
The eldest Oyster looked at him
But never a word he said
The eldest Oyster winked his eye
And shook his heavy head
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster bed

(Alright? You ready? Okay
A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four
But four young Oysters hurried up
All eager for the treat
A four young ... you gotta use the chord ... oh
'Cause you gotta go clang
One, two ... okay ...clang ...  okay
A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four)

But four young Oysters hurried up
All eager for their treat
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed
Their shoes were clean and neat
And this was odd because, you know
They hadn't any feet
Four other Oysters followed them
And yet another four
And thick and fast they came at last
And more, and more, and more
All hopping through the frothy waves
And scrambling to the shore

The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row

""The time has come,"" the Walrus said
""To talk of many things
Of shoes, and ships and sealing wax
Of cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot
And whether pigs have wings""

(But wait a bit
It's alight, we'll let you start
But wait a bit
Ah, c'mon, get it together, man
C'mon
One, two, three)

""But wait a bit,"" the Oysters cried
""Before we have our chat
For some of us are out of breath
And all of us are fat""
""No hurry,"" said the Carpenter
They thanked him much for that

""A loaf of bread,"" the Walrus said
""Is what we chiefly need
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear
We can begin to feed""

""Not on us,"" the Oysters cried
Turning a little blue
""After such kindness that would be
A dismal thing to do""
""The night is fine,"" the Walrus said
""Do you admire the view?""

""It was so kind of you to come
And you are very nice""
The Carpenter said nothing but
""Cut us another slice
I wish you were not quite so deaf
I've had to ask you twice""

""It seems a shame,"" the Walrus said
""To play them such a trick
After we've brought them out so far
And made them trot so quick""
The Carpenter said nothing but
""The butter's spread too thick""

""I weep for you,"" the Walrus said
""I deeply sympathize""
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size
Holding his pocket handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes

""O, Oysters,"" said the Carpenter
""You've had a pleasant run
Shall we be trotting home again?""
But answer came there none
And this was scarcely odd because
They'd eaten every one
They'd eaten every oneEmbed"
1971	"""Everything Is Beautiful"""	Male	Ray Stevens	"Jesus loves the little children
All the little children of the world
Red and yellow, black and white
They are precious in his sight
Jesus loves the little children of the world
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer night
Or a snow covered winter's day
Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

There is none so blind
That is he who will not see
We must not close our minds
We must let our thought be free
For every hour that passes by
You know the world
Gets a little bit older
It's time to realize
That beauty lies
In the eyes of the beholder
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights
Or a snow covered winter's day
Ah, sing it, children
Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way

We shouldn't care
About the length of his hair
Or the color of his skin
Don't worry about what shows from without
But the love that lives within
We're gonna get it all together now
Everything gonna work out fine
Just take a little time
To look on the good side my friend
And straighten it out in your mind

Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nights
Or a snow covered winter's day
Ah, sing it, children
Everybody's beautiful
In their own way
Under God's heaven
The world's gonna find a way
One more time
Everything is beautiful
In its' own way
Like a starry summer nightsEmbed"
1971	"""Fire and Rain"""	Male	James Taylor	"Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now15Embed"

And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing
Or maybe we just stopped trying

And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh no no no no (no no, no no)

It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool

And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (we can't make it)
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Ohhhh, nooo no

But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it, too
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you

But it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (we can't make it)

More than I did in the past time

After the cash
A dick in they ass
And I'm kicking them fast to the sidewalk and I'm gone

No regrets, can't stop it, my lord, oh no

Everybody voicing opinions
They minions
Disagree with me for you it's true
And you know they could suck a big one
A big one
A motherfucking big one
They treating you like a victim of the diction

Something that could flip my lights on
Someone to bring home to my mom and my dad
I like that
Wanna try some
Not giving a fuck about what they say
Dont give a fuck whats in my way

Every box on my list you can cross off
We a perfect match
Ever heard of that?
Roberta Flack she spot on
The first time
The first time
Saw your face it paused time
Radically was attracting me and I can't believe you're all mine
All mine, oh my
Everybody is warning you of my story
But you can afford to to turn and ignore
'Cause you already know that you were made just for me
For me
You were made just for me
Fucked up my life
Searching for a wife
You turned it all right when you called me
You had your own life with a man and a crib
Had a career
Handled your shit
You tore it all down
Dismantled it quick
Once you saw what happiness is
Broke it apart
Started anew
Time to restart and depart into blue
Making it hard
Harder for you
Can't disregard what the heart is into
Partial to you
Stand at your side
Either get with us or tell us good bye
Advising against me but they gonna find
They'll be eating their words while you and me fly

1973	"""Alone Again (Naturally)"""	Male	Gilbert O'Sullivan	"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people saying
""My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining""
""We may as well go home""
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
All about God and His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me
In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that
There are more hearts
Broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?

Alone again, naturally
Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally22Embed"
1973	"""American Pie"""	Male	Don McLean	"A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock 'n roll
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

Oh, and there we were, all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die...""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

And they were singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
Can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

If living is without you...5Embed"

I heard he sang a good song

A stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me
As if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words

I'm not trying to make you anything at all

And here I am with mine

1976	"""At Seventeen"""	Female	Janis Ian	"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear-skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen

A brown-eyed girl in hand-me-downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity, please, the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve""
And the rich-relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly
Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen


To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
When dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me

We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
They call and say, ""Come dance with me""
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me
At seventeen4Embed"
1976	"""Lyin' Eyes"""	Unknown	Eagles	"City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

Late at night, a big, old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has it's price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
She is headed for the cheatin' side of town

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

On the other side of town, a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night, anticipating
Because he makes her feel the way she used to feel
She rushes to his arms, they fall together
She whispers that it's only for a while
She swears that, soon, she'll be comin' back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool

My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things?
You're still the same old girl you used to be
You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes

Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969""
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice, and she said
""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back

1978	"""Blue Bayou"""	Female	Linda Ronstadt	"
I feel so bad I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou

Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be
Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickels saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou

Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

Oh that boy of mine
By my side
The silver moon
And the evening tide
Oh some sweet day
Gonna take away
This hurting inside

Well I'll never be blue
My dreams come true
On Blue Bayou2Embed"

You've found someone new
And don't it make my brown eyes blue
I'll be fine when you're gone
I'll just cry all night long, say it isn't true
And don't it make my brown eyes blue
Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies
Give me no reasons, give me alibis
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye
I didn't mean to treat you bad
Didn't know just what I had
But honey now I do

I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone
To sing me his song
So many dreams
I've kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark
But now you've come along

And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song

Rolling at sea
Adrift on the water
Could it be finally
I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance
To say, ""Hey, I love you,""
Never again
To be all alone

It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you
You light up my lifeEmbed"

I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go tryin'
Some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair, mmm mmm

Unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever

I never want to work that hard

I want you just the way you are
I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
Ahh, what will it take 'til you believe in me
The way that I believe in you

I said I love you

1979	"""Baker Street"""	Male	Gerry Rafferty	"
Windin' your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day, you'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
And it's taking you so long to find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin', you're tryin' now
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now


Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen and you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down, in some quiet little town
And forget about everything
But you know he'll always keep movin'
You know he's never gonna stop movin'
'Cause he's rollin', he's the rollin' stone
And when you wake up, it's a new mornin'
The sun is shinin', it's a new mornin'
You're goin', you're goin' home

You said ""hello""

Your name is music to my heart

I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares
You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend
You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity

The sentimental fool don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize it never really was

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all

Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
(If love can come and love can go, then why can't love return once more?)
Is always better than nothing
(Who got the power?)
Than nothing at all (Oh, now)
What a fool believes
(I believe she's never gone away) he sees
No wise man has the power (to reason away)

We were young and we knew
In our eyes, we're alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night, something right
Would invite us to begin the day

Something happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Something happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had

And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

For awhile, to love each other with all
We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Oh, baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had
'Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared
This affair would lead our love in two
Something happened along the way
Yesterday was all we had
Something happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Something happened along the way
Oh, and yesterday was all we had

And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?

1980	"""The Gambler"""	Male	Kenny Rogers	"On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So, if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right""

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep
And when he finished speakin'
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em)
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done18Embed"

But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now, go, walk out the door

I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free

1982	"""(Just Like) Starting Over"""	Male	John Lennon	"Once upon a time there was a working class hero
Who wanted to give power to the people so
He asked us to imagine a world of peace,love and truth
To give peace a chance,
Do you want to know a secret from me to you?
All you need is love so love me do
And whether the music was acoustic or rock and roll
He walked the long and winding road 'till he wore out his rubber sole
With his old brown shoe
He broke walls and bridges down
Made us come together
'Caused us all to twist and shout
He was the one to tell us what goes on
Number nine, number nine revolution

John
John
Le-le-le-le-le-le-le-lennon
John
Oh, john
Le-le-le-le-le-le-le-lennon

He was a paperback writer
As well as pen and verse
His best known publication was a spaniard in the works
And in his own right
He would write and write and write
Cause you should do whatever gets you through the night
Every man has a woman who loves him more than any other
But for this boy,who'd compare to john lennons mother?
She's a woman named yoko
She's something new
So hold on john, because she loves you
This is real love
No more cover versions
Their love was just like starting over,two virgins
He was happier then anybody'd ever seen
But the boys at abbey road,didn't want to let it be

He went to live in new york city,but he lived on borrowed time
Living life with the lines,he was shot by a jealous guy
With a revolver,but don't ask me why
Life's little more then: Hello, goodbye
My, what a souvenir from their visit to america
Now hes going to strawberry fields forever
Hardly instant karma, but
Calm your nerves
Cause this beautiful boy's now as free as a bird

Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real-time world, no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice-blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it
You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night
There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

Ooh, oh

There's a phrase that fits

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right

Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here trying to write this book

Favorite actor Dennehy, favorite drink O'Doul's
Bears, Hawks, Sox, Bulls

So say goodbye a little longer like I ate a piece of Big Red
Grew a mustache the size of Mike Ditka's forehead
Hair combed to the side looking like a piece of foam
Buick speakers, red cooler, '85 Bears Zubaz
Polish sausage, bratwurst, walking like my cock hurts
Stacy Adams, no shirt, Jewel's to get a case of Squirt
Wife's pissed cause I forgot to get the Minute Rice
So I'm back in the damn Buick to get a stinking bag of ice
To get a stinking bag of rice, my wife Jules is cute
Her taste really moved me like I ate Juicy Fruit
Had me dancing like Chris Penn in Footloose
'85 Walter Roo's, Old Style pack of Kools
Go to Ace, new tools and weed wacker fuel
'85 Bears Zubaz, Stacy Adams got ruined
Flood a basement sump pump, Shop-Vac cleanup
Cook brats, cook chops, your heat shouldn't be that hot
Keep your juices in the chops, keep your juices in the brats
Serve 'em on paper plates, 'tato salad and grape pop

Drink about four O'Doul's, grounded out, two pop flies
In the Buick down Western, stop and get some more brats
On sale: chicken, Italian sausages, and orange pop
This week, fishing trip, gotta get some new flies
Wife packed turkey subs, Jays chips, and peach pies
Watch a little Dennehy, pull out the Laserdisc
Sniper 1, 2, and 3, Berenger makes great flicks
Listen to the Shuffle, rewind Richard Dent's part
Damn I left those orange pops in the trunk of the Skylark
Sneak a couple O'Doul's, shit there's my damn wife
You know, honey, I'll be back I gotta get some more ice
Back in the damn Buick, I should go to the damn bar
I saw Ditka once on the Edens in a sports car

Play a little poker, spend time with the wife
Take her out to Bennigan's, see if they cook chops right
Go out and get a Laserdisc, projection screen TV
Portillo's Italian beef and a movie starring Tommy B
Back in the damn Buick, cut on WCKG
Caught a song by Glenn Frey and an interview with Dennehy
So I'm driving down Western Ave, think I'm gonna stop at Zayre's
Got a splittin fricking headache, so I popped a couple Bayers
So I'm back in the damn Buick, think I need a oil check
The Baddest of George Throrogood smokes Stoges on my deck

Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A

Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man

I was born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A
Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says, ""Son if it was up to me""
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said, ""Son, don't you understand""
I had a brother at Khe Sanh
Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go

Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm going to show you what I'm made of
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone


Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the
Radio on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong

1986	"""The Power of Love"""	Unknown	Huey Lewis and the News	"The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling that's the power of love
Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
That's the power makes the world go'round

And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it?
Hmmm


It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel

Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohoh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohoh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohoh
Bring me a higher love
I could rise above on a higher love

I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along
Bring it

I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be

Oh

Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

Teach them well and let them lead the way

Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying

Well, everybody sees you're blown apart

Maybe I've a reason to believe
We all will be received in Graceland

1988	"""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"""	Unknown	U2	"I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for


I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it

But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

If you hear something late at night
Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was

I think it's 'cause I'm clumsy
I try not to talk too loud
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
I try not to act too proud

And after that, you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore

Well, if you ask, that's what I'll say

With nothing broken, nothing thrown

1989	"""Don't Worry, Be Happy"""	Male	Bobby McFerrin	"Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy (Look at me, I'm happy)

Don't worry, be happy
(Hey I'll give you my phone number, when you worry call me I'll make you happy!)
Don't worry, be happy
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Now there is the song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note, like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
Now listen to what I said, in your life expect some trouble
When you worry you make it double
But don't worry, be happy, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

1989	"""Fast Car"""	Female	Tracy Chapman	"You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together, we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
When mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school, and that's what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight, or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together, you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind
And make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out of reach
The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together
We can calm a stormy sea

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes, I tell you now
That I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, honey

Everybody's got opinions
'Bout the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again
We love so strong and so unselfishly
They don't bother me so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, baby
They don't bother me
Said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got

Listen, baby
Somebody understands me
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long
Always on my own
Now I'm home

My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone
I like the sound of your song
And I think I want to sing it forever

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I made a vow so I tell you now
I'm giving you the best that I got

Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be

1990	"""Wind Beneath My Wings"""	Female	Bette Midler	"Oh, oh, oh, oh

It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you
Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

Fly, fly, so high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky
Thank you, thank you
Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings3Embed"
1990	"""The End of the Innocence"""	Male	Don Henley	"And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by
But ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly
Oh, but I know a place where we can go
Still untouched by men
Sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind
You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
O' beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie
Oh, but I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast
But, somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
Oh nah nah

Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door
I know that I'm a prisoner to all my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage, to all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years
Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thought
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got
You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talking in defence

Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye
So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts
So don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different day
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be okay

Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)
When we die (oh, when we die)
To admit we don't see eye to eye

I wasn't there that morning
When my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say
I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him
In the living years

Say it loud (say it loud)
Say it clear (say it clear)
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late (It's too late)

Things go wrong, they always do

Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me?
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard
All died when you went away

And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch
Yo, I told you (Can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school's in, sucka (You can't touch this)

Give me a song, or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' 'bout the Hammer, you're talkin' 'bout a show
That's hyped, and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

That's word because you know (You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
Break it down!

Stop, Hammer time!

Go with the flow, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave yo hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
(Bump, bump, bump)
Yeah (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)
You better get hype, boy, because you know you can't (You can't touch this)
Ring the bell, school's back in
Break it down!

Stop, Hammer time!

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down!

Stop, Hammer time!

Every time you see me, the Hammer's just so hyped
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doin' this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's ""Hammer!"" ""Go Hammer!"" ""MC Hammer!"" Yo Hammer!""
And the rest can go and play
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Yeah (You can't touch this)
I told you (Can't touch this)
Too hot (Can't touch this)
Yo, we outta here (Can't touch this)33Embed"
1991	"""Vision of Love"""	Female	Mariah Carey	"Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you
Cause how could you give your love to someone else

I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know
The river is wide
I walk down every evening
And I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find
What I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole
I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't
Want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is
That I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never
Been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire
I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams

In the middle of the night

And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause

All I wanna do is have some fun

Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon, but

I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

I saw my reflection in a window, I didn't know my own face
Oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' away
On the Streets of Philadelphia

I walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
It was just as black and whispering as the rain
On the Streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I, my friend
My clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles
Just to slip this skin

The night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the Streets of Philadelphia6Embed"

There used to be a greying tower alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey

You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?

But did you know that when it snows

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey

I've been kissed by a rose on the grey

1996	"""Gangsta's Paradise"""	Male	Coolio	"
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin' I don't know
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they frontin', that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

1996	"""Waterfalls"""	Unknown	TLC	"A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time, he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(Your way or no way)
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)
Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to

And I can change the world

Baby if I could change the world

If I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way
And our love would rule
In this kingdom we have made
'Til then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day

Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
Junebug skippin' like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end
To it all

And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see

That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement
Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it
To see

That we don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

Take shelter on my front porch
The dandelion sun scorching
Like a glass of cold lemonade

I will do the laundry
If you pay all the bills

Where is my John Wayne?
Where is my prairie song?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the cowboys gone?

Why don't you stay the evening?
Kick back and watch the TV
And I'll fix a little something to eat
Oh, I know your back hurts
From working on the tractor
How do you take your coffee, my sweet?
I will raise the children
If you pay all the bills

Where is my John Wayne?
Where is my prairie song?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the cowboys gone?

I am wearing my new dress tonight
But you don't, but you don't even notice me
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes

We finally sell the Chevy
When we had another baby
And you took that job in Tennessee
You made friends at the farm
And you join them at the bar
Almost every single day of the week

I will wash the dishes
While you go have a beer
Where is my John Wayne?
Where is my prairie song?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the cowboys gone?
Where is my Marlboro Man?
Where is his shiny gun?
Where is my lonely ranger?
Where have all the cowboys gone?
Where have all the cowboys gone?
Where have all the cowboys gone?

I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go 'til we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I'd hold to
In my life, we'll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? (Feet)
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day (Light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?
And tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were
Looking for yourself?
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

To dance along the light of day?

Sometimes I shave my legs and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I won't

It really just depends on whatever feels good in my soul (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

I'm not the average girl from your video (Oh)

Confusion's the name of the game
A misconception, a vast deception
Something's got to change
Now don't be offended, this is all my opinion
Ain't nothing that I'm saying law
This is a true confession of a life learned lesson
I was sent here to share with y'all
So get in when you fit in, go on and shine
Clear your mind, now's the time
Put your salt on the shelf
Go on and love yourself (Go on and love yourself, go on and love yourself)

I don't need that to have a good time
Keep your expensive cars and your caviar

Don't need your silicone, I prefer my own

I don't know why I didn't come
I left you by the house of fun
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come

When I saw the break of day
I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever

Out across the endless sea
I would die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

My heart is drenched in wine
But you'll be on my mind
Forever
Something has to make you run

""I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows""
Also, wir bleiben safe bei diesem One-Take-Ding?
""If I fail, if I succeed""
Okay!
""At least I'll live as I believe""
Ah, yeah!
""No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity""
Ah!
""Because the grea—""

Keiner lacht mehr, Mama, ich war beim Notar, Mama
GmbH, Mama, ich glaub', ich brauch' 'ne Havanna
Zwei Jahre lang kein Lebenszeichen
Ich hab' gewartet wie ein kleines Kind am Zebrastreifen
Weil ich dacht', so Business-Sachen sind wie Wissenschaften
Bis ich verstanden hab': Ich muss nur ein paar Schritte machen
Und endlich alle andern sich nach mir richten lassen
Von nun an nur noch Bling-Bling und Cristal-Flaschen
Doch bevor wir so weit sind, sammeln Gerichte Akten
Bullen stürmen die Hotelsuite, um mich zu fassen
Ich tausche ein paar Bitches gegen ein paar Mitinsassen
Yeah, ich schätze, sowas nennt man „Licht und Schatten“
Nach nur acht Stunden wieder frei, danke Gott!
Doch das Ganze hat Haken wie ein Angel-Shop
Andre Leute gehen Sonntag früh zum Gottesdienst
Bei mir steh'n Fotografen vor dem Haus, ich seh' das objektiv
Als die beiden mit dem Streit in jeder Zeitung sind
Kämpfen sie ums Recht auf Shindy, als wär' ich ein Scheidungskind
Jeder will den Krieg gewinn'n, ich wurd' zum Matchball
Ab da wusst' ich, dieses Spielchen wird zum Rechtsfall
Ich sag': „Ich will raus“, aber man lässt mich nicht
Ich sag': „Ich zahl' euch aus“, aber man lässt mich nicht
Plötzlich reichen die Probleme bis nach Bietigheim
Bis vor die Haustür, ich muss nicht weiter ausführ'n
Cops woll'n ein Statement, BILD will ein Statement
Doch ich red' lieber mit 'ner MILF über Spray-Tan
Fick aufs Spotlight, Accounts offline
Kein Output, dafür Bauschutt
Stell' ein Studio hin, wo ich das erste Mal gekifft hab'
Vier Leute teilen eine Zwei-Liter-Schwip-Schwap
Damit zuhause keiner etwas riecht, essen wir Tic Tac
Jetzt sitz' ich hier auf Samtsofas und so Schnickschnack
Persische Teppiche, Überwachungsmonitor wie Scarface
Noch immer Hotels und Heartbreaks
Labels renn'n mir hinterher, ich kann alles haben
Ob ich Millionär bin, musst du Alex fragen
Ich bleib' ein Kind, er macht das Business mit sein'n Assistenten
Hasse nicht Erwachsensein, hass' nur, wie Erwachsne denken
Alles, was ich will, ist 100k im Monat Taschengeld
Eine Patek, einen Phantom und 'ne Mademoiselle
Manchmal schmeckt das Leben wie ein Obstragout
Manchmal kriegt jeder, der dir helfen will, 'nen Drohanruf
Manchmal wird die Rolex von dei'm Vater aus dei'm Haus geklaut
Und manchmal willst du gar nicht wissen, wer es war
Ich kann das niemals meiner Mutter erzähl'n
Oder dass zehntausend Euro aus der Schublade fehl'n, yeah
Das ist das Gefühl, wenn du nicht weißt, wem du vertrau'n kannst
Ich wünscht', wir wär'n wie damals jetzt, mit Alkopops vor Kaufland
ID auf den brandneuen Nikes
Ich bin Ice-T, wie die Zeit fliegt
Vor sechs Jahr'n exmatrikuliert
Doch in sechs Jahr'n mehr gelernt, als hätt' ich sechs Jahre studiert, yeah
Ich hab' dich letztens noch geseh'n in deiner scheiß Karre
An der Kreuzung bei McDonald's, Polizeiwache
Du dachtest damals, du wirst NBA-Pro
Guck auf die Day-Date, Bro, den Rolls-Royce Wraith, Bro
Wer ballt jetzt, Junge? Ich hol' den Rebound
Seh' fresher aus als damals mein Profilbild bei GreekTown
Du sahst aus, als würd' dich dein Beamtenalltag reizen
Danke für die beste rote Ampel aller Zeiten
Ich weiß noch früher, große Pause, Raucherstein
Alles, was ich wollte, war da stehen und genauso sein
Carhartt Beanies, Osiris D3s
Weiße Dickies-Sweater, Riot-City-Rapper
Jetzt ist euer Leben nur noch Zweitliga, ah
Jeden Tag nine-to-five Minesweeper, ah
Damals hieß es, „Open-Mic, nur Shindy kann nicht rein!“
Heute heißt es, „Ey, du bist doch Shindy, kann das sein?“
Ich scheiß' auf eure Riot-City-Jams
Ich bin immer noch Bissingens 50 Cent
Ich steh' morgens dann auf, wenn ich will
Und piss' auf meine alte Schule von mei'm Haus in den Hills, eh
Ich lach' jetzt, Mama, haha, Mama
Die schaufeln mir kein Grab, die bau'n mir eine Grabkammer
Papa meinte, er ist stolz, in meinem Traum neulich
Wir hab'n nicht viel gemeinsam, aber ich war lange blauäugig
Ich dachte, so Intrigen gibt's nur in 'ner Daily-Soap
Oder irgendwelchen Serien von HBO
Alle selbstsüchtig, auf die harte Art gelernt
Dass es keine Freunde gibt, sobald das Geld mitmischt
Paradox, dass wir das Label „Friends with Money“ nenn'n
Was soll ich sagen? Der holt 'n Rolls-Royce Cullinan
Das war ein Dilemma, so wie Nelly featuring Kelly Rowland
Eh, doch ich bin back für meinen Magic-Moment
Den ganzen Tag im Studio wie ein Vocalcoach
Das ist kein Comeback, ich nenn' das Road to GOAT
Geh und richt es deinen Freunden aus, schöne Grüße
Keine Pilotenbrille, doch es folgen Höhenflüge
Nur paar Dinge, die rausmussten
Drip – Vorsicht, nicht ausrutschen, ah!2Embed"

Walkin' fast, faces pass
And I'm homebound
Starin' blankly ahead
Just makin' my way
Makin' a way through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight

It's always times like these when I think of you
And I wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong, and I don't belong
Livin' in your precious memory
'Cause I'll need you
And I'll miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky

And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more; they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents; my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit-for-tat with
Anybody who's talking ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me; you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But ""got it"" just don't get it till there's nothing at all (Ah!)
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is, ""Nothing is forever""
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance

Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (Okay), shake it, sugar

2004	"""Lose Yourself"""	Male	Eminem	"Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

2004	"""Where Is the Love?"""	Unknown	The Black Eyed Peas & Justin Timberlake	"What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

People killin', people dyin'
Children hurtin', hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity

And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?

2007	"""You're Beautiful"""	Male	James Blunt	"My life is brilliant
My life is brilliant, my love is pure
I saw an angel, of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yeah, she caught my eye, as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was, fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, you're beautiful

There must be an angel, with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you45Embed"

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""

One minute I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

2010	"""Halo"""	Unknown	Beyoncé	"Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm lookin' now

She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door

Give me a call back if you can?""

Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

Can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now

Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

One hand in the air for the big city (Oh)
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty (Oh)
No place in the world that could compare (Nah)
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say

The man then pushes her onto the wall and aims his fist at her, puncturing the wall instead. After Rihanna sings again, the video flashes back to when the couple first meet ""at a seedy dive bar next door"" to a liquor store. The man steals a bottle of vodka and they kiss on the rooftop
During the present, the man apologizes to his lover and they are reconciled. In another flashback, he attacks someone who plays pool with his lover. Eminem joins Rihanna in front of the burning house for the final verse. Meanwhile, after the flashback, the woman comes home and locks herself in the bathroom to stop her abusive lover from entering
In another scene, the fire on her palms vanish as she clasps her hands. Flames later engulf Eminem and the couple, who are then shown fighting in front of the burning house. In the end, the couple stay together and the video returns to their first scene, in which they sleepEmbed"

Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind
The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I won't let you choke

After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road

You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it, friend, it's on its head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

Third and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me ""Lip Parade""
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent
Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles
Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I, and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now, to know it in my memory

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles61Embed"

Kendime senin benim için doğru olan kişi olduğunu söyledim
Ama seninle birlikteliğimde çok yalnız hissettim
Ama bu aşktı ve hala hatırladığım bir acıydı

Üzüntünün belli bir haline bağımlı olabilirsin
Mesela sona boyun eğmek her zaman sonu getirir
O yüzden beraber bir anlama gelmediğimizi anladığımızda
Yani, hala arkadaş kalabileceğimizi söylemiştin
Ama itiraf edeyim, bittiğine çok sevinmiştim

Ama beni kesip atmana gerеk yoktu
Bunlar hiç yaşanmamış ve hiçbir şey değilmişiz gibi davranmana gеrek yoktu
Ve aşkına ihtiyacım bile yok
Ama bana sanki bir yabancıymışım gibi davranıyorsun ve bu bana çok koyuyor
Hayır, kendini bu kadar alçaltmana gerek yoktu
Arkadaşlarına bendeki eşyalarını toplattırıp sonra da numaranı değiştirdin

Şimdi sen benim sadece eskiden tanıdığım birisin
Şimdi sen benim sadece eskiden tanıdığım birisin
Şimdi sen benim sadece eskiden tanıdığım birisin
Şu aralar beni mahvettiğin tüm o anları düşünüyorum
Ama beni, bunu her zaman benim yaptığım bir şey olduğuna inandırdın
Ama ben bu şekilde yaşamak istemiyorum
Söylediğin her sözün altında bir anlam aramak
Bunu boş verebileceğini söyledin

The holes in my apologies

So will someone come and carry me home?

We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll
So, if that's what's you're into then go ahead and move along

Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that
No, I'm just playing I know you think you're fat

I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin' it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
I never miss a beat
I'm lightnin' on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
I'm dancin' on my own (Dancin' on my own)

And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been gettin' down
To this sick beat

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, ""Oh my God!"" But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake

2016	"""Blank Space"""	Female	Taylor Swift	"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless

2016	"""Can't Feel My Face"""	Male	The Weeknd	"
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know

She told me, ""Don't worry about it""
She told me, ""Don't worry no more""
We both know we can't go without it
She told me, ""You'll never be alone"", oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh

And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know (This I know), girl, I know
She told me, ""Don't worry about it""
She told me, ""Don't worry no more""
We both know we can't go without it
She told me, ""You'll never be alone"", oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face)
But I love it, but I love it, oh (But I love it)
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face when I'm with you)

I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face when I'm with you)

2016	"""Thinking Out Loud"""	Male	Ed Sheeran	"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""

I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

2018	"""Despacito"""	Male	Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber	"It’s the question almost everyone wants to argue about and the debate that never seems to end.
And before you drop the “Haram Police” card and get ready to prepare an essay response in the comments, can I just say that I’m not here to argue the different rulings and opinions on musical instruments, singing, beat boxing, drums and what not. I’m not even going to go there.
I’m going to be doing something different.
I want us to answer this question for ourselves, openly and honestly. In fact, we can even forget I even said the word Haram to begin with.
Let’s instead just ask the question “Is Music harmful?”
And when we say music, I’m going to be very blank, I’m referring to the music that the majority of people are listening to today because that’s what we should be concerned about. The music that’s on our radios, TV’s, phones and iTunes playlists on repeat. The songs that are topping the charts week-in-week-out and have us memorizing their lyrics from A-Z. This is the music I’m referring to.
Should we, as Muslims be fine listening to this stuff?
Well, let’s take a look for yourselves and decide.
The Hot 100 Billboard Charts has these songs topping the charts for the current week.

Despacito:
Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee Featuring Justin Bieber
“You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on”
Wild Thoughts:
DJ Khaled, Rhianna, Bryson Teller
“I don’t know if you could take it
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked”

That’s what I like:
Bruno Mars
“Go pop it for a player, pop-pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player, drop-drop it for me”

I’m the One:
DJ Khaled, Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne, Quavo
“Roll my eyes
And when she on the molly she a zombie”

Unforgettable:
French Montanna
“If you loved the girl then I’m so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
No, no I won’t tell nobody”
“If you want drama, Grab the Uzi”.

A quick Google search of the lyrics of these songs will let you know exactly the kinds of messages they contain. You honestly don’t have to read far until you come across references to drugs, sexual promiscuity, violence or alcohol. Even when lyrics can seem somewhat innocent, they are underlined with the most vulgar and shameless of meanings. And the saddest part of it all, there’s even some Muslims actually making these songs.
And yes, I’m sure we can argue all day that not all songs are this bad and there are some “good songs” out there, but the fact of the matter is the statistics speak for themselves when they mention that the vast majority of today’s music is riddled with such references and as the day’s go by content is only getting worse.
And as I’ve mentioned before, I’m not here to argue the Islamic rulings on instruments and the various opinions of scholars on music, because, in all honesty, these opinions are irrelevant when we consider them in light of the music being listened to today. I mean, do you seriously want to argue the permissibility of instruments when Muslims are listening to Nicki Minaj?
And we can go ahead and argue that we’re strong and that the music isn’t necessarily influencing us, but the fact of the matter is – it does. And whether you realize it or not, when you constantly grant such music free access to your ears, it is affecting you. It’s normalizing the worst of sins to the point we can sing about them happily and joyfully.
And if you were so sure that the things you listen to won’t affect your life, why not switch up a music playlist with some Quran and see what change it would have in your life. Even if you don’t understand a word being recited, just listen to it and see what kind of impact it will leave on your soul. There’s no denying that our ears are gateways into our hearts and we should be very careful who we allow access to.
And lastly, I know we all have shortcomings and weaknesses, and I know not all of us are the perfect ideal Muslims – but the least we can do is acknowledge that it’s wrong so that perhaps we can start making an effort to change.
May Allah help us all.Embed"

Gold-plated quarters, where the butlers be
I'ma play the corners where the hustlers be
I told him, ""Please don't die over the neighborhood
That your mama rentin'
Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood
That's how you rinse it""
I bought every V12 engine
Wish I could take it back to the beginnin'
I coulda bought a place in DUMBO before it was DUMBO
For like 2 million
That same building today is worth 25 million
Guess how I'm feelin'? Dumbo

You wanna know what's more important than throwin' away money at a strip club? Credit
You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it

Financial freedom my only hope
Fuck livin' rich and dyin' broke
I bought some artwork for one million
Two years later, that shit worth two million
Few years later, that shit worth eight million
I can't wait to give this shit to my children
Y'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine
But I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99
I turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8
I turned my life into a nice first week release date
Y'all out here still takin' advances, huh?
Me and my niggas takin' real chances, uh
Y'all on the 'Gram holdin' money to your ear
There's a disconnect, we don't call that money over here, yeah

Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'

It's a turn on, you didn't wait from me
Leave me alone, keep away from me
And it sounds wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just think for the life, for the days
For the hours and another like breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

With your quiet voice and impeccable style
Don't ever let them steal your joy
And your gentle ways, to keep 'em from running wild
They can kick dirt in your face
Dress you down, and tell you that your place
Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine
I see you tugging on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts

Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them

You get discouraged, don't you, girl?
It's your brother's world for a while longer
You gotta dance with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt in your face
To call you weak and then displace you
After carrying your baby on your back across the desert
I saw your eyes behind your hair
And you're looking tired, but you don't look scared
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends

You wouldn't wonder why you hear

But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

Oh,  oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh

We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame

2021	"""Colors"""	Unknown	Black Pumas	"I woke up to the morning sky first
Baby blue, just like we rehearsed
When I get up off this ground, I shake leaves back down
To the brown, brown, brown, brown 'til I’m clean
Then I walked where I'd be shaded by the trees
By a meadow of green
For about a mile
I'm headed to town, town, town in style

With all my favorite colors, yes, sir
All my favorite colors, right on
My sisters and my brothers see ’em like no other
All my favorite colors

It's a good day to be, a good day for me
A good day to see my favorite colors, colors
My sisters and my brothers, they see 'em like no other
All my favorite colors

Now take me to the other side
Little bitty blues birds fly
In gray clouds, or white walls, or blue skies
We gon' fly, feel alright
And we gon', ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, yeah
They sound like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, yeah
And the least I can say, I anticipate
A homecome parade as we renegade in the morning, right on
With all my favorite colors, yes, sir
All my favorite colors, yes, ma'am
My sisters and my brothers see 'em like no other
All my favorite colors
Ha, oh

Closer, ooh

All my favorite colors, right

2021	"""Don't Start Now"""	Female	Dua Lipa	"If you don't wanna see me

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)

I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

2021	"""Say So"""	Female	Doja Cat	"Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily, I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it bad
Take it, own it, steal it fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so110Embed"

2022	"""Freedom"""	Male	Jon Batiste	"When I move my body just like this
I don't know why
But I feel like freedom (Freedom)
I hear a song that takes me back
And I let go with so much freedom (Freedom)
Free to live (How I wanna live)
I'm gon' get (What I'm gonna get)
'Cause it's my freedom (Freedom)

I love how you talk
You speaking my language
The way that you walk
You can't contain it
Is it the shoes
Jumped up, kangaroo
We're overdue for a little more prancing

Now it's your time
(It's your right)
You can shine
(It's alright)
If you do
I'ma do too
When I move my body just like this
I don't know why
But I feel like freedom (Freedom)
I hear a song that takes me back
And I let go
With so much freedom (Freedom)
Free to live (How I wanna live)
I'm gon' get (What I'm gonna get)
'Cause it's my freedom (Freedom)

The reason we get down, is to get back up
If someone's around, go on let them look
You can't stand still
This ain't no drill
More than cheap thrills (Feels like money, money, money)

Now it's your time
(It's your right)
You can shine
(It's alright)
If you do
I'ma do too
'Cause when I look up to the stars (Stars)
I know exactly who we are (Ooh)
'Cause then I see you shine
You shinin'
You shinin' oh!
Free to be!

Give you just what you ask for
Givin' you the whole shake

2022	"""Happier Than Ever"""	Female	Billie Eilish	"When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)292Embed"

2022	"""Leave the Door Open"""	Unknown	Silk Sonic	"Say baby, say baby, say baby

What you doin'? (What you doin'?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Oh, you got plans? (You got plans)
Don't say that (Shut your trap)
I'm sippin' wine (Sip, sip) in a robe (Drip, drip)
I look too good (Look too good)
To be alone (Woo, woo)
My house clean (House clean), my pool warm (Pool warm)
Just shaved, smooth like a newborn
We should be dancin', romancin'
In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happenin'?

I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms

I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
(Tell me that you're comin' through)
Ooh, you're so sweet (So sweet), so tight (So tight)
I won't bite (Uh-uh), unless you like (Unless you like)
If you smoke (What you smoke?), I got the haze (Purple haze)
And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets (Woo)
Ooh, baby, don't keep me waitin'
There's so much love we could be makin' (Shamone!)
I'm talkin' kissin', cuddlin'
Rose petals in the bathtub
Girl, let's jump in, it's bubblin'

I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms (If you tryna lay in these arms)

I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you're comin' through (Come on, girl)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I need you, baby)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I got to see you, baby)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Girl, I'm tryna give you this, ah)
Hey, hey, I'ma leave my door open, baby
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave, I'ma leave my door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
And I'm hopin', hopin'
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you're comin' through (Woo!)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Tell me)
Tell me that you're comin' through

Tell me that you're comin' through
Girl, I'm here just waitin' for you (Oh!)
Come on over, I'll adore you (I gotta know!)

You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hopin' I could catch you throwin' smiles in my face
Romantic talkin'? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right

Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Ayy, ayy
I wanna sell what you're buyin'
I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'
Oh, oh, oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shinin' on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy

Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

2022	"""Peaches"""	Male	Justin Bieber featuring Daniel Caesar and Giveon	"Ich hab' meine Pfirsiche draußen in Georgia (Oh ja, Scheiße)
Ich bekomme mein Weed aus Kalifornien (Das ist der Scheiß)
Ich habe mein Mädchen mit in den Norden genommen, ja (Knallharte Bitch)
Ich bekomme mein Licht direkt von der Quelle, ja (Ja, das ist es)

Und ich sage, oh (Ohh)
Die Art, wie ich dich einatme (Ein-)
Es ist die Textur deiner Haut
Ich möchte meine Arme um dich legen, Baby
Lasse dich niemals gehen, oh
Und ich sage, oh
Es gibt nichts, das wie deine Berührung ist
Es ist die Art, wie du mich aufbaust
Ja, und ich werde bei dir sein bis zum Ende der Zeit

Ich hab' meine Pfirsiche draußen in Georgia (Oh ja, Scheiße)
Ich bekomme mein Weed aus Kalifornien (Das ist der Scheiß)
Ich habe mein Mädchen mit in den Norden genommen, ja (Knallharte Bitch)
Ich bekomme mein Licht direkt von der Quelle, ja (Ja, das ist es)

Du bist dir noch nicht sicher
Aber ich bin es für dich
Alles, was ich wollen könnte, alles, was ich mir wünschen könnte
Einsame Nächte, in denen wir mehr vermissen
Und Tage bewahren wir als Souvenirs auf
Es gibt keine Zeit mehr, ich möchte mehr Zeit haben
Und dir mein ganzes Leben geben
Ich hab' mein Mädchen verlassen, ich bin auf Mallorca
Hasse es, sie zu verlassen, nenn es Folter
Erinnere mich zurück, wie ich sie nicht halten könnte
Habe ihr das Gepäck für Rimowa zurückgelassen
Ich hab' meine Pfirsiche draußen in Georgia (Oh ja, Scheiße)
Ich bekomme mein Weed aus Kalifornien (Das ist der Scheiß)
Ich habe mein Mädchen mit in den Norden genommen, ja (Knallharte Bitch)
Ich bekomme mein Licht direkt von der Quelle, ja (Ja, das ist es)

Ich bekomme das Gefühl, also bin ich mir sicher (Sicher)
Hand in meiner Hand, weil ich deins bin (Ich kann nicht)
Ich kann es nicht vortäuschen, ich kann es nicht ignorieren, du bist richtig für mich
Denk nicht, du würdest willst wissen wollen, wo ich war, ohh
Ich bin fertig damit, abgelenkt zu sein
Die Eine, die ich brauche, ist direkt in meinen Armen (Oh)
Deine Küsse schmecken sich so süß mit meinen
Und ich werde bei dir sein bis zum Ende der Zeit

Ich hab' meine Pfirsiche draußen in Georgia (Oh ja, Scheiße)
Ich bekomme mein Weed aus Kalifornien (Das ist der Scheiß)
Ich habe mein Mädchen mit in den Norden genommen, ja (Knallharte Bitch)

2022	"""Right on Time"""	Female	Brandi Carlile	"Come back now, even if you call me out
You might be angry now, of course you are
I'm scared too, didn't mean to take it out on you
I know I always do, you're the strongest person in the room
Turn back time, help me to rewind and we can
Find ourselves again

It's not too late
Either way, I lose you in these silent days
It wasn't right
But it was right on time

Don't look down
I can feel it when your heart starts pounding
It's beyond your control, you know it is
It's getting to the point where I can't carry on
I never held my breath for quite this long
And I don't take it back, I did what I had to do

It's not too late
Either way, I lose you in these silent days
It wasn't right
But it was right on time

It's not too late
Either way, I lose you in these silent days
It wasn't right
But it was right on time1Embed"
